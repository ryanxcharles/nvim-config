i use rust and clippy and rust-analyzer in neovim. however, something changed recently, and this configuration in my nvim config no longer works:

```lua
          settings = {
            ["rust-analyzer"] = {
              cargo = { allFeatures = true },
              checkOnSave = { command = "clippy" }, -- Run clippy on save
            },
          },
```

the rust_tools.setup method is expecting "checkOnSave" to be a boolean. however, if it is a boolean, how does is know what command to run on save? any idea how to fix?

# === ASSISTANT ===

The issue you're encountering is likely due to a change in the configuration structure or API of `rust-analyzer` or `rust-tools.nvim`. The `checkOnSave` field in the `rust-analyzer` settings used to accept an object with a `command` field to specify the linter (like `clippy`), but this has changed in newer versions of `rust-analyzer` or the associated Neovim LSP setup.

In the current setup, `checkOnSave` is expected to be a boolean in `rust-analyzer` settings, and the command to run (e.g., `clippy`) is configured separately via `rust-analyzer.diagnostics`. Here's how you can fix it.

### Updated Configuration
You can configure `rust-analyzer` to use `clippy` for diagnostics by setting `check.command` instead of `checkOnSave.command`. Here's the corrected configuration for your Neovim setup using `rust-tools.nvim`:

```lua
local rt = require("rust-tools")

rt.setup({
  server = {
    settings = {
      ["rust-analyzer"] = {
        cargo = {
          allFeatures = true,
        },
        check = {
          command = "clippy", -- Use clippy for checking
        },
        checkOnSave = true, -- Enable checking on save
      },
    },
  },
})
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **`checkOnSave`**: This is now a boolean that simply toggles whether `rust-analyzer` runs a check when you save a file.
2. **`check.command`**: This specifies the command to run for diagnostics. Setting it to `"clippy"` ensures that `clippy` is used for linting and diagnostics when `checkOnSave` is enabled.

### Why Did This Happen?
The `rust-analyzer` configuration schema has evolved over time, and older configurations using `checkOnSave.command` have been deprecated or restructured. The `rust-tools.nvim` plugin now adheres to the updated schema, where `checkOnSave` is a boolean and the command is specified under `check.command`.

### Additional Notes
- If you're using an older version of `rust-tools.nvim` or `rust-analyzer`, you might need to update them to ensure compatibility with the new configuration schema.
- You can check the `rust-analyzer` documentation or the `rust-tools.nvim` repository for the latest configuration options to ensure you're using the correct fields.
- If you want to confirm the settings are applied, you can use Neovim's `:LspInfo` command to inspect the active LSP configuration for `rust-analyzer`.

### Troubleshooting
If this configuration still doesn't work:
1. Ensure that `clippy` is installed and accessible in your PATH. You can install it with:
   ```bash
   rustup component add clippy
   ```
2. Check if `rust-tools.nvim` or your LSP client is outdated. Update your plugins using your Neovim plugin manager (e.g., `PackerSync` or `Lazy`).
3. Look at the LSP logs (`:LspLog`) to see if there are any errors related to `rust-analyzer` configuration.

i updated my rust version recently, and i think the lsp has gotten worse. hard to describe, but i think it's showing me less diagnostics in the editor than before. are there more settings i need to use to make rust analyzer show more diagnostics?

```lua
  {
    "simrat39/rust-tools.nvim",
    dependencies = { "neovim/nvim-lspconfig" },
    config = function()
      local rust_tools = require("rust-tools")

      local opts = { noremap = true, silent = true }

      -- rust: Rust tools setup with rust-analyzer
      rust_tools.setup({
        server = {
          on_attach = function(client, bufnr)
            -- Keybindings for LSP features in Rust files
            vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(
              bufnr,
              "n",
              "gd",
              "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.definition()<CR>",
              opts
            )
            vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(
              bufnr,
              "n",
              "K",
              "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.hover()<CR>",
              opts
            )
            vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(
              bufnr,
              "n",
              "<Leader>ca",
              "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.code_action()<CR>",
              opts
            )
            vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(
              bufnr,
              "n",
              "<Leader>rn",
              "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.rename()<CR>",
              opts
            )
          end,
          settings = {
            ["rust-analyzer"] = {
              cargo = { allFeatures = true },
              check = {
                command = "clippy", -- Use clippy for checking
                features = "all", -- Enable all features
              },
              checkOnSave = true
            },
          },
        },
      })
    end,
  },
```
