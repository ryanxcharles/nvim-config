i use rust and clippy and rust-analyzer in neovim. however, something changed
recently, and this configuration in my nvim config no longer works:

```lua
settings = {
  ["rust-analyzer"] = {
    cargo = { allFeatures = true },
    checkOnSave = { command = "clippy" }, -- Run clippy on save
  },
},
```

the rust_tools.setup method is expecting "checkOnSave" to be a boolean. however,
if it is a boolean, how does is know what command to run on save? any idea how
to fix?

# === ASSISTANT ===

The issue you're encountering is likely due to a change in the configuration
structure or API of `rust-analyzer` or `rust-tools.nvim`. The `checkOnSave`
field in the `rust-analyzer` settings used to accept an object with a `command`
field to specify the linter (like `clippy`), but this has changed in newer
versions of `rust-analyzer` or the associated Neovim LSP setup.

In the current setup, `checkOnSave` is expected to be a boolean in
`rust-analyzer` settings, and the command to run (e.g., `clippy`) is configured
separately via `rust-analyzer.diagnostics`. Here's how you can fix it.

### Updated Configuration

You can configure `rust-analyzer` to use `clippy` for diagnostics by setting
`check.command` instead of `checkOnSave.command`. Here's the corrected
configuration for your Neovim setup using `rust-tools.nvim`:

```lua
local rt = require("rust-tools")

rt.setup({
  server = {
    settings = {
      ["rust-analyzer"] = {
        cargo = {
          allFeatures = true,
        },
        check = {
          command = "clippy", -- Use clippy for checking
        },
        checkOnSave = true, -- Enable checking on save
      },
    },
  },
})
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **`checkOnSave`**: This is now a boolean that simply toggles whether
   `rust-analyzer` runs a check when you save a file.
2. **`check.command`**: This specifies the command to run for diagnostics.
   Setting it to `"clippy"` ensures that `clippy` is used for linting and
   diagnostics when `checkOnSave` is enabled.

### Why Did This Happen?

The `rust-analyzer` configuration schema has evolved over time, and older
configurations using `checkOnSave.command` have been deprecated or restructured.
The `rust-tools.nvim` plugin now adheres to the updated schema, where
`checkOnSave` is a boolean and the command is specified under `check.command`.

### Additional Notes

- If you're using an older version of `rust-tools.nvim` or `rust-analyzer`, you
  might need to update them to ensure compatibility with the new configuration
  schema.
- You can check the `rust-analyzer` documentation or the `rust-tools.nvim`
  repository for the latest configuration options to ensure you're using the
  correct fields.
- If you want to confirm the settings are applied, you can use Neovim's
  `:LspInfo` command to inspect the active LSP configuration for
  `rust-analyzer`.

### Troubleshooting

If this configuration still doesn't work:

1. Ensure that `clippy` is installed and accessible in your PATH. You can
   install it with:
   ```bash
   rustup component add clippy
   ```
2. Check if `rust-tools.nvim` or your LSP client is outdated. Update your
   plugins using your Neovim plugin manager (e.g., `PackerSync` or `Lazy`).
3. Look at the LSP logs (`:LspLog`) to see if there are any errors related to
   `rust-analyzer` configuration.

i updated my rust version recently, and i think the lsp has gotten worse. hard
to describe, but i think it's showing me less diagnostics in the editor than
before. are there more settings i need to use to make rust analyzer show more
diagnostics?

```lua
  {
    "simrat39/rust-tools.nvim",
    dependencies = { "neovim/nvim-lspconfig" },
    config = function()
      local rust_tools = require("rust-tools")

      local opts = { noremap = true, silent = true }

      -- rust: Rust tools setup with rust-analyzer
      rust_tools.setup({
        server = {
          on_attach = function(client, bufnr)
            -- Keybindings for LSP features in Rust files

              "K",
              "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.hover()<CR>",
              opts
            )
            vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(
              bufnr,

    end,

# === ASSISTANT ===

If you've noticed a decrease in the number of diagnostics shown by
`rust-analyzer` in Neovim after updating your Rust version, there are several
potential reasons and additional settings you can tweak to ensure you're getting
the maximum diagnostics and feedback. Let's go through some common causes and
solutions, and I'll suggest additional `rust-analyzer` settings to enhance
diagnostic reporting.

### Possible Reasons for Fewer Diagnostics

1. **Rust Version Update**: Updating Rust might have changed the behavior of
   `clippy` or `rustc`, which `rust-analyzer` relies on for diagnostics. Newer
   versions of `clippy` might suppress certain warnings by default or require
   explicit configuration.
2. **Rust-Analyzer or Plugin Update**: If `rust-analyzer` or `rust-tools.nvim`
   was updated alongside Rust, the configuration schema or default behavior
   might have changed, leading to fewer diagnostics being shown.
3. **Diagnostics Settings**: By default, `rust-analyzer` might not show all
   diagnostics (e.g., warnings from dependencies or certain lints) unless
   explicitly configured.
4. **Neovim LSP Client**: The Neovim LSP client or `rust-tools.nvim` might
   filter or limit diagnostics display based on severity or other settings.

### Enhancing Diagnostics in Rust-Analyzer

To ensure you're seeing as many diagnostics as possible, you can configure
`rust-analyzer` to be more verbose and include diagnostics from `clippy`,
dependencies, and other sources. Below is an updated version of your
configuration with additional settings to maximize diagnostics.

### Updated Configuration

```lua
{
  "simrat39/rust-tools.nvim",
  dependencies = { "neovim/nvim-lspconfig" },
  config = function()
    local rust_tools = require("rust-tools")

    local opts = { noremap = true, silent = true }

    -- rust: Rust tools setup with rust-analyzer
    rust_tools.setup({
      server = {
        on_attach = function(client, bufnr)
          -- Keybindings for LSP features in Rust files
          vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(
            bufnr,
            "n",
            "gd",
            "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.definition()<CR>",
            opts
          )
          vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(
            bufnr,
            "n",
            "K",
            "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.hover()<CR>",
            opts
          )
          vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(
            bufnr,
            "n",
            "<Leader>ca",
            "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.code_action()<CR>",
            opts
          )
          vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(
            bufnr,
            "n",
            "<Leader>rn",
            "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.rename()<CR>",
            opts
          )
        end,
        settings = {
          ["rust-analyzer"] = {
            cargo = {
              allFeatures = true, -- Build with all features enabled
              features = "all", -- Ensure all features are considered during analysis
            },
            check = {
              command = "clippy", -- Use clippy for checking
              features = "all", -- Enable all features for clippy
              extraArgs = { "--all", "--", "-W", "clippy::all", "-W", "clippy::pedantic" }, -- Enable more clippy lints
            },
            checkOnSave = true, -- Run checks on save
            diagnostics = {
              enable = true, -- Explicitly enable diagnostics
              disabled = {}, -- Don't disable any diagnostics by default
              enableExperimental = true, -- Enable experimental diagnostics (if available)
            },
            rustc = {
              source = "discover", -- Automatically discover rustc source for better diagnostics
            },
          },
        },
      },
    })
  end,
},
```

### Explanation of New Settings

1. **`check.extraArgs`**: This allows you to pass additional arguments to
   `clippy`. Here, I've added `--all` to check all targets, and `-W clippy::all`
   and `-W clippy::pedantic` to enable more strict lints. This can surface more
   warnings and suggestions that might have been suppressed.
2. **`diagnostics.enable` and `diagnostics.disabled`**: Explicitly enabling
   diagnostics and ensuring no categories are disabled by default helps ensure
   you're seeing everything `rust-analyzer` can report.
3. **`diagnostics.enableExperimental`**: This enables experimental diagnostics
   that might not be fully stable but can provide additional feedback.
4. **`rustc.source = "discover"`**: This tells `rust-analyzer` to automatically
   detect the `rustc` source, which can improve diagnostics by ensuring the
   correct version of the compiler is used for analysis.

### Additional Steps to Diagnose and Fix

If you're still seeing fewer diagnostics after applying these settings, consider
the following steps:

1. **Check Clippy Version and Lints**:
   - Ensure `clippy` is installed and up-to-date:
     ```bash
     rustup component add clippy
     rustup update
     ```
   - Run `clippy` manually on your project to see if it produces more
     diagnostics than `rust-analyzer` shows:
     ```bash
     cargo clippy --all-features --all -- -W clippy::all -W clippy::pedantic
     ```
   - If `clippy` shows more diagnostics in the terminal, the issue might be with
     how `rust-analyzer` integrates or filters diagnostics.

2. **Inspect LSP Logs**:
   - Use Neovim's `:LspLog` command to check for errors or warnings from
     `rust-analyzer`. This can reveal configuration issues or suppressed
     diagnostics.
   - Look for messages about ignored or filtered diagnostics.

3. **Check Neovim Diagnostic Settings**:
   - Ensure that Neovim's diagnostic display isn't filtering out warnings or
     info-level diagnostics. You can configure this globally or per-buffer
     using:
     ```lua
     vim.diagnostic.config({
       virtual_text = true, -- Show diagnostics as virtual text
       signs = true, -- Show signs in the gutter
       underline = true, -- Underline issues
       severity_sort = true, -- Sort by severity
       float = {
         border = "rounded",
         source = "always", -- Show source of diagnostics
       },
     })
     ```
   - If diagnostics are still not showing, ensure no other plugin (like a linter
     or formatter) is interfering with LSP diagnostics.

4. **Update Rust-Analyzer and Plugins**:
   - Ensure `rust-analyzer` is up-to-date. If you're using a plugin manager like
     `packer.nvim` or `lazy.nvim`, update all plugins:
     ```lua
     :PackerSync  -- or equivalent for your plugin manager
     ```
   - You can also manually update `rust-analyzer` if installed separately:
     ```bash
     rustup component add rust-analyzer
     ```

5. **Check Project Configuration**:
   - If your project has a `.cargo/config.toml` or `Cargo.toml` with specific
     `clippy` or `rustc` settings, they might suppress diagnostics. Look for
     `lint` or `warn` configurations and adjust them to allow more warnings.

6. **Verbose Output**:
   - Temporarily enable verbose logging for `rust-analyzer` to see what it's
     doing. Add this to your settings:
     ```lua
     ["rust-analyzer"] = {
       trace = {
         server = "verbose", -- Enable verbose logging
       },
     }
     ```
   - Check the logs with `:LspLog` to see if diagnostics are being generated but
     not displayed.

### Final Notes

- If you're still not seeing the expected diagnostics, consider comparing the
  behavior with a minimal Neovim configuration to rule out plugin interference.
- You can also test `rust-analyzer` in another editor (like VS Code with the
  Rust extension) to confirm if the issue is with `rust-analyzer` itself or
  Neovim's LSP integration.

Let me know if you need help interpreting logs or if the issue persists after
trying these settings!

if i wanted to remap `zt` to `zt10<C-y>`, would that be an infinite loop, or
would that work?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Remapping `zt` to `zt10<C-y>` in Neovim would **not** result in an infinite
loop, and it should work as intended, provided you define the mapping correctly.
Let's break down why this is the case and how to implement it.

### Why It Won't Cause an Infinite Loop

In Neovim (and Vim), when you create a mapping for a key or sequence like `zt`,
the mapping applies to the user input, not to the internal execution of
commands. The `zt` in your mapping on the right-hand side (`zt10<C-y>`) is
interpreted as the literal command `zt`, not as a recursive call to your custom
mapping. Neovim does not re-evaluate the mapped command through the mapping
system unless you explicitly use a recursive mapping (e.g., with `noremap` not
being used).

By default, mappings created with `map` are recursive, meaning if `zt` on the
right-hand side referred to a custom mapping, it could potentially cause a loop.
However, since `zt` is a built-in Vim command (which scrolls the current line to
the top of the window), it is not subject to remapping during execution. Thus,
`zt` in `zt10<C-y>` will always execute the original built-in behavior of `zt`,
not your custom mapping.

Additionally, using `noremap` (or its mode-specific variants like `nnoremap`)
ensures that the right-hand side of the mapping is interpreted literally,
without considering any other mappings. This further prevents any risk of
recursion.

### What `zt10<C-y>` Does

- `zt`: Scrolls the current line to the top of the window.
- `10<C-y>`: Scrolls the view up by 10 lines (since `<C-y>` scrolls up one line
  by default, and the `10` prefix multiplies the effect).

So, `zt10<C-y>` will first position the current line at the top of the window
(`zt`), then scroll the view up by 10 lines (`10<C-y>`), effectively positioning
the current line 10 lines below the top of the window after the initial `zt`.

### How to Implement the Mapping

To remap `zt` to `zt10<C-y>`, you can use the following in your Neovim
configuration (e.g., in your `init.lua` or equivalent):

```lua
vim.keymap.set('n', 'zt', 'zt10<C-y>', { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

### Explanation of Options

- `'n'`: Applies the mapping in normal mode.
- `noremap = true`: Ensures the right-hand side (`zt10<C-y>`) is not subject to
  further remapping, though in this case, it’s not strictly necessary since `zt`
  and `<C-y>` are built-in commands.
- `silent = true`: Prevents the command from being echoed in the command line.

Alternatively, if you're using the older `nvim_buf_set_keymap` or raw Vim
commands, you can write it as:

```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', 'zt', 'zt10<C-y>', { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

Or directly in Vimscript style (if you're using a `.vim` file or mixed
configuration):

```vim
nnoremap <silent> zt zt10<C-y>
```

### Testing for Potential Issues

While this mapping should work without causing an infinite loop, here are a few
things to watch for:

1. **Conflicting Mappings**: Ensure no other plugin or custom mapping interferes
   with `zt` or `<C-y>`. You can check existing mappings with `:map zt` or
   `:map <C-y>` in Neovim.
2. **Behavior Verification**: Test the mapping in different contexts (e.g., near
   the top or bottom of a file) to confirm it behaves as expected. The `10<C-y>`
   part might not scroll if you're already near the top of the file, but it
   won't cause errors or loops.

### Why It Might Seem Like a Loop Could Happen

You might worry about a loop because the left-hand side (`zt`) appears in the
right-hand side (`zt10<C-y>`). However, as mentioned, Neovim evaluates the
right-hand side as raw commands (especially with `noremap`), so `zt` on the
right-hand side is treated as the built-in command, not as a trigger for the
mapping itself.

If you were mapping something that could recursively call itself (e.g., a custom
sequence that re-triggers the same input), and you didn't use `noremap`, a loop
could occur. For example:

```vim
map zt zt
```

This would cause a loop if `zt` on the right-hand side were interpreted as the
mapping rather than the built-in command. But since you're using `zt` as a
built-in followed by a distinct action (`10<C-y>`), and ideally using `noremap`,
there’s no risk.

### Final Notes

Your proposed mapping `zt` to `zt10<C-y>` will work as expected without causing
an infinite loop. It will execute the built-in `zt` to scroll the current line
to the top, then scroll up 10 lines with `10<C-y>`. If you test it and notice
unexpected behavior (e.g., due to other mappings or plugins), let me know, and I
can help debug further!

# === USER ===

in neovim, is there a way to select the current line, but not with `V`, which
selects the newline at the end, but rather just the text of the current line
without including the newline character?

# === ASSISTANT ===

In Neovim (and Vim), the `V` command selects the current line in line-wise
visual mode, which includes the newline character at the end of the line. If you
want to select only the text of the current line without the newline character,
you can use character-wise visual mode (`v`) combined with specific motions to
achieve this.

There isn't a built-in single command to directly select "the current line
without the newline," but you can create a custom mapping or use a sequence of
commands to do it. Below, I'll explain how to do this manually and how to map it
for convenience.

### Manual Method to Select Current Line Without Newline

You can select the text of the current line (excluding the newline) by using
character-wise visual mode (`v`) and moving from the start to the end of the
line's text:

1. Move to the start of the line's text (ignoring leading whitespace if
   desired):
   - `^` : Move to the first non-whitespace character of the line.
   - Alternatively, use `0` to move to the absolute start of the line (including
     leading whitespace).
2. Enter visual mode with `v`.
3. Move to the end of the line's text:
   - `$h` : Move to the last character of the line (`$` moves to the end,
     including the newline, and `h` moves one character left to exclude it).

So, the full sequence would be:

- `^v$h` (if starting from the first non-whitespace character)
- OR `0v$h` (if starting from the absolute beginning of the line)

This selects all characters on the current line, from the start to the last
character before the newline.

### Custom Mapping to Automate This

To make this easier, you can create a custom mapping in your Neovim
configuration to select the current line's text (without the newline) in
character-wise visual mode. Here's how to do it in Lua for your `init.lua`:

```lua
vim.keymap.set('n', 'vl', '0v$h', { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

#### Explanation:

- `'n'`: Applies the mapping in normal mode.
- `vl`: The keybinding you’re assigning (you can change this to whatever you
  prefer, e.g., `<Leader>l`).
- `0v$h`: The sequence of commands:
  - `0`: Move to the start of the line.
  - `v`: Enter character-wise visual mode.
  - `$h`: Move to the last character before the newline.
- `noremap = true`: Prevents recursive mapping.
- `silent = true`: Suppresses command output in the command line.

If you want to start from the first non-whitespace character instead of the
absolute start, use `^` instead of `0`:

```lua
vim.keymap.set('n', 'vl', '^v$h', { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

#### Using Vimscript (if preferred):

If you're using a `.vim` file or prefer Vimscript, you can add:

```vim
nnoremap <silent> vl 0v$h
" OR
nnoremap <silent> vl ^v$h
```

### Edge Cases and Notes

1. **Empty Lines**: If the current line is empty (just a newline), this mapping
   will select nothing, as there are no characters to select. `$h` won't move
   left if there's no character before the newline.
2. **Lines with Trailing Whitespace**: The `$h` motion will stop at the last
   non-newline character, so trailing whitespace will be included in the
   selection. If you want to exclude trailing whitespace, you’d need a more
   complex mapping or plugin.
3. **Behavior with Plugins**: Some plugins might override or interfere with
   visual mode selections. If you notice unexpected behavior, check for
   conflicting mappings with `:map vl` (or whatever keybinding you chose).

### Alternative with a Plugin or Function

If you frequently need to select lines without newlines (or with other specific
behaviors like ignoring trailing whitespace), you can write a small Lua function
or use a plugin. Here's an example of a more customized Lua function to select
the current line's text:

```lua
vim.keymap.set('n', 'vl', function()
  local line = vim.api.nvim_get_current_line()
  if line == "" then
    return -- Do nothing if the line is empty
  end
  vim.cmd('normal! 0v$h') -- Select from start to last character
end, { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

This function checks if the line is empty before attempting to select, avoiding
unnecessary visual mode entry on empty lines.

### Final Notes

- The simplest and most straightforward way is to use `0v$h` or `^v$h` via a
  custom mapping like the one above.
- If you need more advanced selection logic (e.g., excluding trailing
  whitespace), let me know, and I can help craft a more detailed function or
  suggest a plugin.

Try the mapping above, and if you have any issues or want to tweak the behavior
further, feel free to ask!

there is something weird going on with folding in neovim. i have folds enabled
by default. however, files often load without them. then, i will accidentally
press some key strokes which cause the folds to exist. the difference is that
somewhere in ny neovim config is some setting that puts fold information on the
left side of the window. this information will just suddently appear, without
being intentionally provoked by me. however, i haven't yet figured out which
unintentional keystrokes i am hitting that makes this happen. any idea what
these keystrokes are? again, folds are always "enabled", but when i try to close
a fold, it often says "no folds found", unless i press this myserious key
combination first.

# === ASSISTANT ===

It sounds like you're experiencing some inconsistent behavior with folding in
Neovim, where folds are enabled by default but not always active when files
load, and some unintentional keystrokes seem to "activate" them along with fold
information (likely fold markers or the fold column) appearing on the left side
of the window. Let's break this down and identify possible causes, likely
keystrokes, and solutions to make folding behavior more consistent.

### Understanding the Issue

1. **Folds Enabled but Not Active**: You mention folds are "enabled by default,"
   but files often load without folds being applied (e.g., `no folds found` when
   trying to close a fold). This suggests that while Neovim has folding enabled,
   the fold method or fold expression might not be creating folds automatically
   until triggered.
2. **Unintentional Keystrokes Activating Folds**: Some key combination you're
   pressing is likely triggering a command to update or create folds, or to
   enable the fold column (the left-side information you're seeing).
3. **Fold Information on Left Side**: This is almost certainly the fold column,
   which displays indicators (like `+` for closed folds and `-` for open folds)
   to show fold levels. Its sudden appearance suggests a command is toggling it
   on.

### Likely Causes and Keystrokes

Since folds are enabled but not always active, and some mystery keystrokes are
making them appear along with the fold column, here are the most likely
scenarios:

#### 1. Fold Method or Initialization Issue

- Neovim supports different fold methods (`manual`, `indent`, `expr`, `syntax`,
  etc.), and folds might not be created automatically on file load if:
  - The fold method is `manual` (default in many setups), requiring explicit
    fold creation.
  - The fold method is `expr` or `syntax`, but the expression or syntax rules
    aren't applied until a specific command or buffer refresh.
- If you're using a plugin like `treesitter` for folding (common with modern
  Neovim configs), folds might not initialize until a specific action or command
  is run.

#### 2. Common Keystrokes That Could Activate Folds

Here are some common keystrokes that might be triggering the behavior you're
seeing:

- **`zx`**: Updates folds by recalculating them based on the current fold
  method. If folds weren't visible or applied on load, pressing `zx` would
  create or refresh them, making them available for opening/closing. This could
  explain why `no folds found` changes after pressing something.
- **`zR`**: Opens all folds in the buffer. If folds exist but are closed by
  default, this would make them appear "active" (though they were there all
  along).
- **`zM`**: Closes all folds. If you press this accidentally, it might make
  folds visible in the sense that you now see closed fold markers.
- **`za` or `zo`**: Toggles or opens a fold under the cursor. If folds weren't
  rendered or applied yet, Neovim might lazily initialize them when you attempt
  to interact with a fold.
- **`set foldcolumn` or Related Commands**: If you accidentally trigger a
  command like `:set foldcolumn=auto` or `:set foldcolumn=1`, it would enable
  the fold column on the left side. This might happen if you have a mapping or
  plugin that toggles it, or if you're accidentally entering command mode (e.g.,
  pressing `:` followed by random keys).

#### 3. Fold Column Appearing

- The fold column (the left-side information) is controlled by the `foldcolumn`
  option. If it suddenly appears, you might be:
  - Pressing a mapped key that toggles `foldcolumn` (e.g., a leader key or
    plugin binding).
  - Triggering a plugin like `ufo.nvim` or `treesitter` that manages fold
    visualization and toggles the fold column.
  - Accidentally running a command like `:set fdc=1` (short for `foldcolumn=1`).

#### 4. Plugin or Config Interference

- If you're using a folding plugin (like `nvim-ufo`, which enhances folding with
  Treesitter), it might have custom mappings or delayed initialization, causing
  folds to appear only after certain actions.
- Your Neovim config might have `autocmd` events or mappings that toggle fold
  settings or refresh folds on specific actions (like saving or moving the
  cursor).

### How to Investigate and Fix

Let’s go through steps to identify the mystery keystrokes and stabilize your
folding setup.

#### 1. Check Your Current Fold Settings

Run these commands in Neovim to see your current fold configuration:

- `:set foldmethod?` : Shows the fold method (`manual`, `indent`, `expr`, etc.).
- `:set foldexpr?` : Shows the expression used for folding if `foldmethod=expr`.
- `:set foldcolumn?` : Shows the current fold column setting (e.g., `0` for
  disabled, `1` or higher for enabled).
- `:set foldenable?` : Confirms if folding is enabled (should be `foldenable`).

If `foldmethod=manual`, folds won't be created automatically unless you define
them or run a command like `zx`. If it's `expr` or `syntax`, ensure the rules
are set up correctly.

#### 2. Identify Mystery Keystrokes

To figure out what you're pressing that activates folds or the fold column:

- **Check Mappings**: Run `:map` or mode-specific commands like `:nmap` (normal
  mode mappings) to see if any keys are mapped to fold-related commands (`zx`,
  `zR`, `za`, etc.) or to toggle `foldcolumn`.
  - Look for mappings involving `z` (common for fold commands) or `<Leader>`
    keys that might toggle settings.
- **Enable Key Logging (Debugging)**: Neovim doesn't have built-in key logging,
  but you can temporarily enable verbose output to see what commands are being
  executed:
  - Run `:set verbose=9` and then interact with your editor as usual. Check the
    output with `:messages` to see what commands or mappings are triggered when
    folds or the fold column appear.
- **Common Culprits**: Since fold commands often start with `z`, you might be
  accidentally pressing keys like `zx`, `za`, or `zR` while typing or
  navigating. For example, if you meant to type `x` but hit `zx`, it would
  update folds.

#### 3. Stabilize Fold Initialization

To ensure folds are always applied on file load and prevent the "no folds found"
issue:

- **Set Fold Method**: If you want automatic folding, set `foldmethod` to
  something like `indent` or `syntax` in your config. For example, in
  `init.lua`:
  ```lua
  vim.opt.foldmethod = 'indent' -- or 'syntax' or 'expr' depending on preference
  vim.opt.foldenable = true -- Ensure folding is enabled
  vim.opt.foldlevelstart = 99 -- Start with all folds open (adjust as needed)
  ```
- **Force Fold Update on Load**: Add an `autocmd` to update folds when a file is
  loaded:
  ```lua
  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({"BufReadPost", "FileReadPost"}, {
    pattern = "*",
    command = "normal zx", -- Update folds on file load
  })
  ```
  This runs `zx` after a buffer is read, ensuring folds are calculated and
  applied.

#### 4. Control Fold Column Visibility

If the fold column appearing unexpectedly is bothersome, check if it’s enabled
by default or toggled by a mapping:

- **Check Default Setting**: Run `:set foldcolumn?`. If it’s not `0`, it’s
  enabled by default in your config. Disable it with:
  ```lua
  vim.opt.foldcolumn = '0' -- Disable fold column by default
  ```
- **Look for Toggles**: Search your config for `foldcolumn` or `fdc` to see if a
  plugin or mapping toggles it. Common plugins like `nvim-ufo` might enable it
  automatically.
- **Temporary Toggle Mapping**: If you want to control it manually, add a
  mapping to toggle the fold column:
  ```lua
  vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>fc', ':set foldcolumn!<CR>', { noremap = true, silent = true })
  ```

#### 5. Check for Plugins

If you're using a folding plugin (e.g., `nvim-ufo` with Treesitter), check its
documentation for default mappings or initialization behavior. For example,
`nvim-ufo` often uses `zR`, `zM`, and other `z`-based keys for fold management,
and it might enable the fold column automatically. You can disable or remap
these in the plugin’s setup.

### Likely Keystrokes You're Hitting

Based on your description, the most likely unintentional keystrokes are:

- **`zx`**: Updates folds, making them available if they weren’t applied on
  load.
- **`za` or `zo`**: Attempts to toggle/open a fold, which might trigger fold
  initialization.
- A custom mapping or plugin key that toggles `foldcolumn` or refreshes folds.

### Final Recommendations

1. Add the fold initialization `autocmd` mentioned above to ensure folds are
   always applied on load.
2. Set `foldcolumn=0` if you don’t want the left-side information by default, or
   map a toggle for it.
3. Run `:map | grep z` to see all fold-related mappings and identify potential
   accidental triggers.
4. If using a plugin like `nvim-ufo`, review its setup and mappings in your
   config.

Here’s a minimal config snippet to stabilize folding behavior:

```lua
vim.opt.foldmethod = 'indent' -- or 'syntax' or 'expr'
vim.opt.foldenable = true
vim.opt.foldlevelstart = 99 -- Start with folds open
vim.opt.foldcolumn = '0' -- Disable fold column by default

-- Update folds on file load
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({"BufReadPost", "FileReadPost"}, {
  pattern = "*",
  command = "normal zx",
})

-- Optional: Toggle fold column
vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>fc', ':set foldcolumn!<CR>', { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

If you’re still seeing unexpected behavior or want help debugging specific
mappings or plugins, share relevant parts of your config or the output of
`:map | grep z`, and I’ll help narrow it down further!

# === USER ===

i want to reconsider the way i'm loading pyright, the python lsp, inside neovim.
right now, it has to load python from a particular place so that it loads the
corect environment. the problem is, it loads in the same directory as the
editor. but what it should actually do is have a different instance for every
python file. it should go up the directory tree until it finds a
`pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` file, and then use that directory as the root for
the LSP. is this possible?

```lua
lspconfig.pyright.setup({
  settings = {
    python = {
      pythonPath = vim.fn.getcwd() .. "/.venv/bin/python", -- Use cwd as artintellica
    },
    pyright = {
      typeCheckingMode = "basic",
    },
  },
})
```

# === ASSISTANT ===

Yes, it is absolutely possible to configure the Pyright LSP in Neovim to
dynamically determine the root directory for each Python file by searching up
the directory tree for a `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` file (or other markers)
and then use that directory as the root for the LSP. This approach ensures that
Pyright operates in the correct project context, especially when working with
virtual environments or multiple projects. Additionally, you can configure it to
find the appropriate Python interpreter (e.g., in a `.venv` directory) relative
to that root.

Let’s modify your current setup to achieve this behavior using `nvim-lspconfig`
for Pyright. I'll explain how to set a dynamic root directory and how to locate
the correct Python environment for each file.

### Current Issue

In your current configuration:

```lua
lspconfig.pyright.setup({
  settings = {
    python = {
      pythonPath = vim.fn.getcwd() .. "/.venv/bin/python", -- Use cwd as root
    },
    pyright = {
      typeCheckingMode = "basic",
    },
  },
})
```

- `vim.fn.getcwd()` uses the current working directory of Neovim (where you
  launched the editor), not the directory of the file you're editing. This means
  every Pyright instance uses the same root and virtual environment, regardless
  of the file's location.
- This approach doesn't adapt to different projects or files in different
  directories, which can lead to incorrect diagnostics or missing dependencies
  if the file belongs to a different project.

### Solution: Dynamic Root Directory and Python Path

To make Pyright use a different instance per project (based on the file's
location), you can:

1. **Set a Dynamic Root Directory**: Use the `root_dir` option in `lspconfig` to
   search for project markers like `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` by traversing
   up the directory tree from the file's location.
2. **Dynamically Set the Python Path**: Configure Pyright to locate the Python
   interpreter (e.g., in `.venv/bin/python`) relative to the determined root
   directory, or let Pyright auto-detect it based on the project root.

Here’s how to implement this.

### Updated Configuration

```lua
local lspconfig = require('lspconfig')

lspconfig.pyright.setup({
  -- Dynamically determine the root directory for each file
  root_dir = lspconfig.util.root_pattern('pyproject.toml', 'setup.py', '.git', 'requirements.txt'),
  settings = {
    python = {
      -- Optionally, specify a pythonPath if needed; otherwise, Pyright can auto-detect
      -- pythonPath = function()
      --   local root = lspconfig.util.find_git_ancestor(vim.fn.expand('%:p:h'))
      --   if root then
      --     return root .. '/.venv/bin/python'
      --   end
      --   return vim.fn.exepath('python3') or vim.fn.exepath('python') or 'python'
      -- end,
      analysis = {
        autoSearchPaths = true, -- Automatically search for Python paths
        useLibraryCodeForTypes = true, -- Use library code for type checking
        diagnosticMode = 'openFilesOnly', -- Can be 'workspace' for broader analysis
      },
    },
    pyright = {
      typeCheckingMode = 'basic', -- Can be 'off', 'basic', or 'strict'
    },
  },
})
```

### Explanation of Key Changes

1. **`root_dir`**:
   - `lspconfig.util.root_pattern('pyproject.toml', 'setup.py', '.git', 'requirements.txt')`
     tells Neovim to search upward from the current file's directory for any of
     the specified markers. The first directory containing one of these files or
     directories will be used as the root for the LSP.
   - This ensures that each file is associated with its project root, allowing
     separate Pyright instances for different projects. For example:
     - If a file is in `/project1/src/module.py` and `pyproject.toml` is in
       `/project1/`, the root will be `/project1/`.
     - If another file is in `/project2/app/main.py` with `setup.py` in
       `/project2/`, the root will be `/project2/`.
   - You can customize the list of markers to include other files or directories
     (e.g., `venv`, `.venv`, `Pipfile`).

2. **`python.pythonPath`** (Commented Out in Example):
   - I’ve included a commented-out example of dynamically setting `pythonPath`
     based on the root directory. If uncommented, it tries to find a
     `.venv/bin/python` relative to the root.
   - However, Pyright can often auto-detect the correct Python interpreter if
     `autoSearchPaths` is enabled (see below). You might not need to explicitly
     set `pythonPath` unless you have a very specific setup.
   - If auto-detection fails, uncomment and adjust the `pythonPath` function to
     match your virtual environment structure (e.g., `venv/bin/python` on
     Windows might be `venv/Scripts/python.exe`).

3. **`python.analysis.autoSearchPaths`**:
   - Setting this to `true` allows Pyright to automatically search for Python
     interpreters and site-packages in the project root or standard locations.
     This often works well with virtual environments if they’re in a standard
     location like `.venv`.

4. **`python.analysis.diagnosticMode`**:
   - Set to `'openFilesOnly'` by default to limit diagnostics to currently open
     files (faster). You can change it to `'workspace'` to analyze the entire
     project, though this might be slower for large projects.

### Additional Considerations

#### Virtual Environment Detection

If Pyright's auto-detection doesn't work for your setup (e.g., non-standard
`.venv` locations), you can use a more explicit `pythonPath` function. Here’s an
enhanced version:

```lua
settings = {
  python = {
    pythonPath = function()
      local root = lspconfig.util.find_git_ancestor(vim.fn.expand('%:p:h'))
      if root then
        local venv_path = root .. '/.venv/bin/python'
        if vim.fn.executable(venv_path) == 1 then
          return venv_path
        end
        venv_path = root .. '/venv/bin/python' -- Alternative venv name
        if vim.fn.executable(venv_path) == 1 then
          return venv_path
        end
      end
      -- Fallback to system Python if no venv is found
      return vim.fn.exepath('python3') or vim.fn.exepath('python') or 'python'
    end,
  },
  -- Other settings as above
}
```

This checks for common virtual environment paths relative to the root and falls
back to a system-wide Python if none are found.

#### Multiple Python Files in Different Projects

With the `root_dir` setting, Neovim will spawn a separate Pyright instance for
each unique root directory. This ensures that files in different projects use
their respective environments and configurations.

#### Debugging Root Directory Issues

If Pyright isn’t picking the correct root directory:

- Use `:LspInfo` to see the root directory and workspace used by Pyright for the
  current file.
- Adjust the `root_pattern` list to prioritize certain markers or add debug
  logging to see which root is being selected.

### Final Notes

This setup should address your need to have a different Pyright instance for
each Python file based on its project root. It dynamically finds the root by
looking for `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, or other markers, and it can be
configured to locate the appropriate virtual environment.

If you encounter issues (e.g., Pyright not finding the correct interpreter or
root), let me know, and I can help refine the configuration further. You might
also want to check Pyright’s documentation for additional settings related to
virtual environment detection or workspace configuration.

Try the updated configuration above, and feel free to share any feedback or
specific project structures you’re working with!

# === USER ===

this is progress, but still doesn't really solve it in my case. i have a project
with many programming languages. the python code is in the `py` directory, which
is not the root of the repo. because the repo also has `rs`, `ts`, and more. i
don't want to put python dependencies all the way at the top, unless i
absolutely need to. is there a way to look up the directory tree from the
current file until it finds a `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` file, and then use
that directory as the root for the LSP?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Yes, it’s definitely possible to configure Pyright in Neovim to search up the
directory tree from the current file’s location until it finds a
`pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` file, and then use that specific directory as the
root for the LSP, even if it’s a subdirectory within a larger multi-language
repository. This approach will work for your case where Python code is in a `py`
subdirectory and you want to keep Python-specific dependencies and configuration
files (like `pyproject.toml`) within that subdirectory rather than at the
top-level root of the repository.

The `nvim-lspconfig` utility `root_pattern` already searches upward from the
current file’s directory for specified markers, so we can use it to achieve
exactly what you’re describing. Let’s refine the configuration to ensure it
works for your nested `py` directory structure and avoids using the top-level
repository root unless necessary.

### Understanding the Problem

In a multi-language project, your directory structure might look like this:

```
/my-project
├── py/
│   ├── pyproject.toml  # Python-specific config
│   ├── .venv/          # Virtual environment for Python
│   └── src/
│       └── module.py   # Python code
├── rs/                 # Rust code
├── ts/                 # TypeScript code
└── .git/               # Top-level repo root
```

- You want Pyright to use `/my-project/py/` as the root for Python files (e.g.,
  `module.py`), not `/my-project/`, because the Python configuration and
  dependencies are in `py/`.
- The default `root_pattern` in `lspconfig` will search upward from the file’s
  directory (`/my-project/py/src/` in this case) and stop at the first directory
  containing a specified marker (e.g., `pyproject.toml` in `/my-project/py/`).

### Solution: Fine-Tuned `root_pattern` for Python Subdirectory

Since `lspconfig.util.root_pattern` already searches upward from the current
file’s directory, we can use it with markers specific to Python projects to
ensure the root is set to the directory containing `pyproject.toml` or
`setup.py`, even if it’s a subdirectory. We’ll also avoid including top-level
markers like `.git` in the pattern (unless you want a fallback), so it
prioritizes Python-specific roots.

Here’s the updated configuration:

```lua
local lspconfig = require('lspconfig')

lspconfig.pyright.setup({
  -- Search up from the current file's directory for Python-specific markers
  root_dir = lspconfig.util.root_pattern('pyproject.toml', 'setup.py', 'requirements.txt'),
  settings = {
    python = {
      analysis = {
        autoSearchPaths = true, -- Automatically search for Python paths
        useLibraryCodeForTypes = true, -- Use library code for type checking
        diagnosticMode = 'openFilesOnly', -- Can be 'workspace' for broader analysis
      },
    },
    pyright = {
      typeCheckingMode = 'basic', -- Can be 'off', 'basic', or 'strict'
    },
  },
})
```

### Explanation of Configuration

1. **`root_dir = lspconfig.util.root_pattern('pyproject.toml', 'setup.py', 'requirements.txt')`**:
   - This tells Neovim to start from the directory of the current file (e.g.,
     `/my-project/py/src/` for `module.py`) and search upward through parent
     directories until it finds one containing `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, or
     `requirements.txt`.
   - In your case, if `pyproject.toml` is in `/my-project/py/`, that directory
     will be selected as the root for Pyright, not `/my-project/`.
   - I’ve excluded `.git` from the pattern to avoid selecting the top-level
     repository root unless no Python-specific markers are found. If you want a
     fallback to the repo root, you can add `.git` back to the list.

2. **`python.analysis.autoSearchPaths = true`**:
   - This allows Pyright to automatically detect the Python interpreter and
     site-packages relative to the determined root directory (e.g.,
     `/my-project/py/.venv/bin/python` if it exists). This often works well for
     standard virtual environment setups.

### Handling Virtual Environment Paths

If Pyright’s auto-detection of the Python interpreter doesn’t work (e.g., your
virtual environment is in a non-standard location), you can explicitly set
`pythonPath` dynamically based on the root directory. Here’s how to add that:

```lua
local lspconfig = require('lspconfig')

lspconfig.pyright.setup({
  root_dir = lspconfig.util.root_pattern('pyproject.toml', 'setup.py', 'requirements.txt'),
  settings = {
    python = {
      pythonPath = function()
        -- Get the root directory determined by root_pattern
        local root = lspconfig.util.root_pattern('pyproject.toml', 'setup.py', 'requirements.txt')(vim.fn.expand('%:p:h'))
        if root then
          -- Check common virtual environment paths relative to the root
          local venv_paths = {
            root .. '/.venv/bin/python',
            root .. '/venv/bin/python',
            root .. '/.venv/Scripts/python.exe', -- For Windows
            root .. '/venv/Scripts/python.exe',  -- For Windows
          }
          for _, path in ipairs(venv_paths) do
            if vim.fn.executable(path) == 1 then
              return path
            end
          end
        end
        -- Fallback to system Python if no venv is found
        return vim.fn.exepath('python3') or vim.fn.exepath('python') or 'python'
      end,
      analysis = {
        autoSearchPaths = true,
        useLibraryCodeForTypes = true,
        diagnosticMode = 'openFilesOnly',
      },
    },
    pyright = {
      typeCheckingMode = 'basic',
    },
  },
})
```

#### Explanation of `pythonPath` Function

- It dynamically retrieves the root directory using the same `root_pattern`
  logic.
- It checks for common virtual environment paths (e.g., `.venv/bin/python`)
  relative to that root.
- If no virtual environment is found, it falls back to a system-wide Python
  interpreter.

### Why This Solves Your Case

- For a file like `/my-project/py/src/module.py`, `root_pattern` will search
  upward and find `pyproject.toml` in `/my-project/py/`, setting that as the
  root for Pyright.
- This ensures Pyright uses the Python configuration and environment specific to
  the `py` subdirectory, not the top-level `/my-project/` directory.
- Other language LSPs (e.g., for Rust in `rs/` or TypeScript in `ts/`) can have
  their own `root_dir` configurations pointing to different roots, ensuring
  separation of concerns.

### Additional Notes and Debugging

1. **Verify Root Directory**:
   - After applying this configuration, open a Python file and run `:LspInfo` to
     confirm the root directory used by Pyright. It should show something like
     `/my-project/py/` if `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` is there.
   - If it’s not picking the correct root, adjust the markers in `root_pattern`
     or double-check the file paths.

2. **Top-Level Fallback (Optional)**:
   - If you sometimes want to fall back to the top-level repo root (e.g., if no
     Python markers are found in subdirectories), add `.git` or another
     top-level marker to the `root_pattern` list:
     ```lua
     root_dir = lspconfig.util.root_pattern('pyproject.toml', 'setup.py', 'requirements.txt', '.git'),
     ```

3. **Multi-Root Workspaces**:
   - Pyright supports multi-root workspaces, but in most cases, setting the root
     per file via `root_dir` as above is sufficient. If you need more complex
     workspace handling, you can explore Pyright’s `workspace` settings.

4. **Performance**:
   - Using `diagnosticMode = 'openFilesOnly'` limits analysis to open files,
     which is faster for large projects. If you need workspace-wide diagnostics,
     change it to `'workspace'`, but be aware it might slow down for large
     codebases.

### Final Configuration for Multi-Language Repo

Here’s a complete example tailored to your multi-language setup, ensuring
Python’s root is correctly set to the subdirectory:

```lua
local lspconfig = require('lspconfig')

lspconfig.pyright.setup({
  root_dir = lspconfig.util.root_pattern('pyproject.toml', 'setup.py', 'requirements.txt'),
  settings = {
    python = {
      pythonPath = function()
        local root = lspconfig.util.root_pattern('pyproject.toml', 'setup.py', 'requirements.txt')(vim.fn.expand('%:p:h'))
        if root then
          local venv_paths = {
            root .. '/.venv/bin/python',
            root .. '/venv/bin/python',
            root .. '/.venv/Scripts/python.exe',
            root .. '/venv/Scripts/python.exe',
          }
          for _, path in ipairs(venv_paths) do
            if vim.fn.executable(path) == 1 then
              return path
            end
          end
        end
        return vim.fn.exepath('python3') or vim.fn.exepath('python') or 'python'
      end,
      analysis = {
        autoSearchPaths = true,
        useLibraryCodeForTypes = true,
        diagnosticMode = 'openFilesOnly',
      },
    },
    pyright = {
      typeCheckingMode = 'basic',
    },
  },
})
```

This should solve your issue by ensuring Pyright uses the closest Python project
directory (e.g., `/my-project/py/`) as the root, rather than the top-level repo
root. If you have other LSPs for Rust (`rs/`) or TypeScript (`ts/`), you can
configure their `root_dir` separately to point to their respective
subdirectories or the top-level root as needed.

Let me know if you run into any issues with this setup or if your directory
structure has additional complexities to account for!

when i run that latest code, i get this error in neovim when opening a file:

```
Error executing vim.schedule lua callback: ...lar/neovim/0.11.2/share/nvim/runtime/lua/vim/lsp/rpc.lua:281: Cannot serialise function: type not supported

```

how do i fix this?

# === ASSISTANT ===

The error you're encountering in Neovim when opening a file with the latest
Pyright LSP configuration is due to attempting to serialize a Lua function
directly in the `settings` table for the LSP client. Specifically, the
`python.pythonPath` field in the `settings` table is set to a Lua function, but
Neovim's LSP client (via `nvim-lspconfig`) expects the `settings` table to
contain only serializable data (like strings, numbers, tables, etc.) that can be
sent to the LSP server as JSON. Functions are not serializable in this context,
which causes the error:

```
Cannot serialise function: type not supported
```

### Why This Happens

In the latest configuration I provided, I included a dynamic `pythonPath` as a
Lua function to determine the Python interpreter path based on the root
directory. While this approach works in theory for local computation, the
`settings` table is passed to the LSP server via the RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
protocol, which requires JSON serialization. Since Lua functions cannot be
converted to JSON, Neovim throws this error when trying to initialize the
Pyright client.

### How to Fix It

To resolve this, we need to compute the `pythonPath` value as a string (the
actual path to the Python interpreter) before passing it to the `settings`
table, rather than passing a function. We can achieve this by using the
`on_new_config` hook provided by `nvim-lspconfig`, which allows us to
dynamically modify the configuration (including `settings`) when a new LSP
client is created for a buffer. This way, we can calculate the `pythonPath` as a
string based on the root directory and set it in `settings` before the
configuration is sent to the server.

Here’s the corrected configuration:

```lua
local lspconfig = require('lspconfig')

lspconfig.pyright.setup({
  root_dir = lspconfig.util.root_pattern('pyproject.toml', 'setup.py', 'requirements.txt'),
  on_new_config = function(new_config, root_dir)
    -- Dynamically set pythonPath based on the root_dir
    local python_path = nil
    if root_dir then
      local venv_paths = {
        root_dir .. '/.venv/bin/python',
        root_dir .. '/venv/bin/python',
        root_dir .. '/.venv/Scripts/python.exe', -- For Windows
        root_dir .. '/venv/Scripts/python.exe',  -- For Windows
      }
      for _, path in ipairs(venv_paths) do
        if vim.fn.executable(path) == 1 then
          python_path = path
          break
        end
      end
    end
    -- Fallback to system Python if no venv is found
    if not python_path then
      python_path = vim.fn.exepath('python3') or vim.fn.exepath('python') or 'python'
    end
    -- Update the settings with the computed pythonPath
    new_config.settings.python.pythonPath = python_path
  end,
  settings = {
    python = {
      analysis = {
        autoSearchPaths = true,
        useLibraryCodeForTypes = true,
        diagnosticMode = 'openFilesOnly',
      },
    },
    pyright = {
      typeCheckingMode = 'basic',
    },
  },
})
```

### Explanation of the Fix

1. **`on_new_config` Hook**:
   - The `on_new_config` function is called by `nvim-lspconfig` when a new LSP
     client configuration is created for a buffer. It receives `new_config` (the
     configuration object) and `root_dir` (the determined root directory for the
     current file based on `root_dir`).
   - We use this hook to dynamically compute the `pythonPath` as a string based
     on the `root_dir`, checking for common virtual environment paths relative
     to the root.
   - Once computed, we set `new_config.settings.python.pythonPath` to the
     resulting string, ensuring it’s a serializable value.

2. **Removed `pythonPath` Function from `settings`**:
   - In the static `settings` table, we no longer include a function for
     `pythonPath`. Instead, it’s populated dynamically via `on_new_config`.
   - The rest of the `settings` (like `analysis` and `typeCheckingMode`) remain
     as static, serializable values.

3. **Fallback for `pythonPath`**:
   - If no virtual environment is found in the root directory, we fall back to a
     system-wide Python interpreter using `vim.fn.exepath('python3')` or
     similar. This ensures a valid path is always set.

### Why This Works

- The `on_new_config` hook runs before the configuration is sent to the LSP
  server, allowing us to compute and set `pythonPath` as a string in the
  `settings` table.
- Since the final `settings` table contains only serializable data (strings,
  booleans, etc.), Neovim can successfully serialize it to JSON for the RPC
  communication with Pyright, avoiding the error.

### Additional Notes

1. **Verify the Configuration**:
   - After applying this, open a Python file and run `:LspInfo` to confirm the
     root directory and settings used by Pyright. Ensure the `pythonPath` is set
     to the expected interpreter (e.g., `/my-project/py/.venv/bin/python` if
     applicable).
   - If the wrong path is selected, adjust the `venv_paths` list in
     `on_new_config` to match your virtual environment structure.

2. **Debugging Issues**:
   - If you still encounter errors, check the LSP logs with `:LspLog` to see if
     there are issues with Pyright initialization or the computed `pythonPath`.
   - You can temporarily add a `print` or `vim.notify` statement in
     `on_new_config` to inspect the computed `root_dir` and `python_path`:
     ```lua
     vim.notify("Root Dir: " .. (root_dir or "none") .. ", Python Path: " .. (python_path or "none"))
     ```

3. **Performance**:
   - The `on_new_config` computation is lightweight and runs only when a new LSP
     client is initialized for a buffer, so it shouldn’t impact performance.

### Final Notes

This corrected configuration should resolve the serialization error by ensuring
that `pythonPath` is set as a string dynamically using `on_new_config` rather
than passing a function directly in `settings`. It still achieves your goal of
searching up the directory tree for Python project markers (`pyproject.toml`,
etc.) and using that directory as the root for Pyright, even in a multi-language
repository with Python in a subdirectory.

If you encounter further issues or need to tweak the virtual environment path
logic, let me know, and I’ll help refine it further!

# === USER ===

this comment to exist terminal mode doesn't seem to exist. i'm pretty sure it
used to, but maybe something changed in the latest neovim. any idea why?

```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("t", "<C-;>", [[<C-\><C-n>]], opts)
```

# === ASSISTANT ===

You're correct that something might have changed or there could be a
misunderstanding regarding terminal mode mappings in Neovim. The keybinding
you're trying to set for exiting terminal mode in Neovim using `<C-;>` with the
command `<C-\><C-n>` should generally work, as it is a valid way to exit
terminal mode. However, there are a few reasons why it might not be working as
expected in your setup with the provided code. Let's explore why this might be
happening and how to fix it.

### Why `<C-;>` Mapping Might Not Work

1. **Terminal Mode Mapping Syntax**:
   - In Neovim, terminal mode mappings (mode `"t"`) are used to define
     keybindings that are active when you're inside a terminal buffer (e.g.,
     after running `:terminal` or using a plugin like `toggleterm.nvim`).
   - The mapping `vim.api.nvim_set_keymap("t", "<C-;>", [[<C-\><C-n>]], opts)`
     attempts to map `<C-;>` (Control + semicolon) to the sequence `<C-\><C-n>`,
     which is the standard sequence to exit terminal mode and return to normal
     mode.
   - However, `<C-;>` might not be recognized correctly by your terminal
     emulator or Neovim due to how control characters are handled. Some terminal
     emulators (like `kitty`, `alacritty`, or `tmux`) may not send `<C-;>` as a
     distinct keycode, or it might be intercepted before reaching Neovim.

2. **Changes in Neovim**:
   - There haven't been major changes in Neovim (up to version 0.11.2) regarding
     terminal mode mappings that would break `<C-\><C-n>` or similar mappings.
     Terminal mode mappings and the `<C-\><C-n>` sequence to exit terminal mode
     are still supported.
   - If you're using a very recent nightly build or a specific version, it's
     possible there’s a bug or a change in behavior, but this is unlikely for
     such a core feature. You can check the Neovim changelog or GitHub issues
     for any related updates.

3. **Terminal Emulator or Environment Issues**:
   - The key `<C-;>` might not be properly sent to Neovim by your terminal
     emulator. Many terminal emulators map Control + certain keys to other
     actions or don’t transmit them correctly.
   - If you're running Neovim inside `tmux` or `screen`, these multiplexers
     might intercept `<C-;>` or remap it to something else.

4. **Mapping Definition Issue**:
   - If `opts` in your code doesn't include `noremap = true`, there might be a
     conflict with another mapping or default behavior.
   - Additionally, ensure that the mapping is being set correctly and that no
     other plugin or configuration overrides it.

### How `<C-\><C-n>` Works in Terminal Mode

- In Neovim’s terminal mode, `<C-\><C-n>` is the built-in key sequence to exit
  terminal mode and return to normal mode. It’s not a command that "doesn't
  exist"; it’s a fundamental part of Neovim’s terminal functionality.
- If it seems to not work, it’s likely due to the input key (`<C-;>`) not being
  recognized or the mapping not being applied correctly.

### Steps to Diagnose and Fix

Let’s go through some steps to diagnose why this mapping isn’t working and how
to fix it.

#### 1. Verify Terminal Emulator Support for `<C-;'>`

- Test if your terminal emulator sends `<C-;>` correctly to Neovim:
  - Open a terminal buffer in Neovim with `:terminal`.
  - Press `<C-;>` and see if anything happens (without the mapping set).
  - Alternatively, enter insert mode in a regular buffer and press `<C-v><C-;>`
    (Control-V followed by Control-semicolon) to see what keycode is inserted.
    If nothing appears or it inserts something unexpected, your terminal
    emulator might not support `<C-;>` as a distinct key.
- If `<C-;>` isn’t recognized, try a different keybinding (e.g., `<C-'>` or
  `<Esc>`) for exiting terminal mode.

#### 2. Check Existing Mappings

- Run `:tmap` in Neovim to see all terminal mode mappings. Look for any
  conflicting mappings for `<C-;>` or `<C-\><C-n>`.
- If another mapping overrides `<C-;>`, you might need to unmap it first or
  choose a different key.

#### 3. Update the Mapping Definition

- Ensure your mapping is defined correctly. Here’s the corrected and explicit
  version using `vim.keymap.set` (preferred in modern Neovim) or
  `vim.api.nvim_set_keymap`:
  ```lua
  local opts = { noremap = true, silent = true }
  vim.keymap.set('t', '<C-;>', '<C-\\><C-n>', opts)
  -- OR, if using the older API
  vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('t', '<C-;>', '<C-\\><C-n>', opts)
  ```
  - Note the use of `<C-\\>` instead of `<C-\>`. In Lua strings, `\` is an
    escape character, so you need to escape it as `\\` to represent a literal
    backslash.
  - `noremap = true` ensures the mapping doesn’t trigger other mappings,
    avoiding potential recursion or conflicts.

#### 4. Test with a Different Key

- If `<C-;>` doesn’t work, try mapping a different key to exit terminal mode.
  Common alternatives include `<Esc>`, `<C-'>`, or a leader key combination:
  ```lua
  vim.keymap.set('t', '<Esc>', '<C-\\><C-n>', { noremap = true, silent = true })
  ```
  - Be aware that `<Esc>` might conflict with other terminal behaviors (e.g., in
    `bash` or `zsh`, `<Esc>` might have other meanings), so test it in your
    workflow.

#### 5. Check Neovim Version

- Ensure you’re using a recent stable version of Neovim (e.g., 0.11.2 as of your
  error message context). If you’re on a nightly build, there might be a
  regression. You can check your version with `:version`.
- If on a nightly, consider switching to a stable release or checking the Neovim
  GitHub issues for terminal mode bugs.

#### 6. Terminal Emulator or Tmux Configuration

- If using `tmux` or `screen`, check their keybinding configurations for
  `<C-;>`. You might need to bind `<C-;>` in `tmux.conf` to pass it through to
  Neovim:
  ```tmux
  bind-key C-; send-keys C-;
  ```
- For terminal emulators like `kitty` or `alacritty`, check their documentation
  for how Control-modified keys are handled. You might need to add a custom
  keybinding in the emulator config to send the correct sequence.

#### 7. Debugging the Mapping

- If the mapping still doesn’t work, add a debug message to confirm it’s being
  set:
  ```lua
  vim.keymap.set('t', '<C-;>', function()
    vim.notify("Exiting terminal mode")
    return '<C-\\><C-n>'
  end, { noremap = true, silent = false, expr = true })
  ```
- If you see the notification but it doesn’t exit terminal mode, there’s an
  issue with `<C-\\><C-n>` being interpreted. If you don’t see the notification,
  the key `<C-;>` isn’t being recognized.

### Final Working Configuration

Here’s a reliable configuration for mapping a key to exit terminal mode. I’ve
included `<C-;>` as the primary attempt and `<Esc>` as a fallback if `<C-;>`
doesn’t work in your terminal emulator:

```lua
local opts = { noremap = true, silent = true }

-- Primary attempt with <C-;>
vim.keymap.set('t', '<C-;>', '<C-\\><C-n>', opts)

-- Fallback with <Esc> if <C-;> doesn't work
vim.keymap.set('t', '<Esc>', '<C-\\><C-n>', opts)
```

### Why It Might Seem Like It "Used to Work"

- If this mapping worked in the past, it could be due to a change in your
  terminal emulator configuration, a Neovim plugin conflict, or an update to
  your shell or multiplexer (like `tmux`) that now intercepts `<C-;>`.
- It’s also possible that you previously used a different key or syntax, and the
  memory of `<C-;>` might be incorrect.

### Final Notes

The `<C-\><C-n>` sequence to exit terminal mode is still valid and supported in
Neovim, so the issue is likely with the input key `<C-;>` not being recognized
by your terminal emulator or Neovim setup. Try the steps above, starting with
verifying `<C-;>` support and testing alternative keys like `<Esc>`. If you’re
still having trouble, let me know your terminal emulator, whether you use
`tmux`, and the output of `:tmap`, and I’ll help debug further!

# === USER ===

i'm going to try switching from prettier to dprint to format markdown code.

i've already installed dprint. how do i update my lua neovim config to use
dprint?

```lua
markdown = {
  -- Prettier for formatting Markdown
  function()
    return {
      exe = "prettier", -- Make sure Prettier is installed globally
      args = {
        "--stdin-filepath",
        vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(0), -- Prettier needs the file path to infer formatting rules
        "--prose-wrap",
        "always", -- Ensures text in markdown files is always wrapped
      },
      stdin = true,
    }
  end,
},
```

# === ASSISTANT ===

To switch from Prettier to `dprint` for formatting Markdown files in your Neovim
configuration, you’ll need to update the formatter settings in your Lua config
to use `dprint` as the formatting tool. Since you’ve already installed `dprint`,
I’ll guide you through updating the configuration to replace Prettier with
`dprint` for Markdown files. I’ll assume you’re using a plugin like
`conform.nvim` (a popular formatter plugin for Neovim) based on the structure of
your provided code snippet. If you’re using a different plugin (like `null-ls`
or `nvim-lint`), let me know, and I can adjust the instructions accordingly.

### Understanding the Current Setup

Your current configuration for Markdown formatting uses Prettier with the
following setup:

```lua
markdown = {
  function()
    return {
      exe = "prettier", -- Prettier executable
      args = {
        "--stdin-filepath",
        vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(0), -- File path for Prettier
        "--prose-wrap",
        "always", -- Wrap text in Markdown
      },
      stdin = true, -- Input is passed via stdin
    }
  end,
},
```

- `exe = "prettier"`: Specifies Prettier as the formatting tool.
- `args`: Custom arguments to control Prettier’s behavior, including wrapping
  prose in Markdown.
- `stdin = true`: Indicates that the file content is passed to Prettier via
  standard input.

### Switching to `dprint`

`dprint` is a fast and configurable code formatter that supports multiple
languages, including Markdown. To use `dprint` instead of Prettier, we’ll update
the `exe` field to point to the `dprint` executable and adjust the `args` to
match `dprint`’s command-line interface for formatting Markdown.

Here’s how to update your configuration:

### Updated Configuration for `dprint`

Assuming you’re using `conform.nvim` (or a similar formatter setup), replace the
Markdown formatter configuration with the following:

```lua
markdown = {
  function()
    return {
      exe = "dprint", -- Use dprint executable
      args = {
        "fmt", -- Format command for dprint
        "--stdin", -- Pass content via stdin
        vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(0), -- Pass the file path for context (helps dprint determine config)
      },
      stdin = true, -- Input is passed via stdin
    }
  end,
},
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **`exe = "dprint"`**:
   - Replaces `prettier` with `dprint` as the formatting tool. Ensure `dprint`
     is installed and accessible in your PATH. You can verify this by running
     `dprint --version` in your terminal.

2. **`args = { "fmt", "--stdin", vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(0) }`**:
   - `fmt`: The `dprint` command to format code.
   - `--stdin`: Tells `dprint` to read input from standard input, which is
     necessary for integrating with Neovim’s formatter plugins.
   - `vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(0)`: Passes the current file’s path to `dprint`.
     While not always required, providing the file path helps `dprint` locate a
     configuration file (like `dprint.json`) in the project directory or infer
     the file type if needed.
   - Removed Prettier-specific arguments like `--prose-wrap always`, as `dprint`
     uses its own configuration for Markdown formatting (see below for
     customizing this).

3. **`stdin = true`**:
   - Remains the same, indicating that the file content is passed to `dprint`
     via standard input.

### Prerequisites

Before this configuration works, ensure the following:

1. **dprint Installation**:
   - You mentioned you’ve installed `dprint`. Confirm it’s in your PATH by
     running `dprint --version` in your terminal. If it’s not found, install it
     following the official instructions (e.g., via `cargo install dprint` if
     using Rust, or download a binary from the `dprint` GitHub releases page).
   - If `dprint` is installed in a non-standard location, update `exe` to the
     full path (e.g., `exe = "/path/to/dprint"`).

2. **dprint Configuration for Markdown**:
   - `dprint` requires a configuration file (`dprint.json` or `.dprintrc.json`)
     to define formatting rules for Markdown. If you don’t have one, create a
     `dprint.json` file in your project root or home directory.
   - Initialize a basic config with:
     ```bash
     dprint init
     ```
     This creates a `dprint.json` file with default settings. Ensure Markdown is
     enabled by including the `markdown` plugin in the configuration. A minimal
     `dprint.json` for Markdown might look like:
     ```json
     {
       "incremental": true,
       "includes": ["**/*.md"],
       "excludes": [],
       "plugins": [
         "https://plugins.dprint.dev/markdown-0.17.8.wasm"
       ],
       "markdown": {
         "textWrap": "always",
         "lineWidth": 80
       }
     }
     ```
     - `textWrap: "always"`: Mimics Prettier’s `--prose-wrap always` behavior by
       wrapping prose text in Markdown files.
     - `lineWidth: 80`: Sets the maximum line width for wrapped text (adjust as
       needed).
     - Check the `dprint` documentation for more Markdown-specific options.

3. **Formatter Plugin**:
   - I’m assuming you’re using `conform.nvim` based on the structure of your
     code. If you’re using a different plugin (e.g., `null-ls`,
     `efm-langserver`, or manual `vim.lsp.buf.format`), the configuration might
     differ slightly. Let me know if you’re using something else.

### Full Example with `conform.nvim`

If you’re using `conform.nvim`, your full formatter setup might look like this
(including Markdown with `dprint`):

```lua
require("conform").setup({
  formatters_by_ft = {
    markdown = {
      function()
        return {
          exe = "dprint",
          args = {
            "fmt",
            "--stdin",
            vim.api.nvim_buf_get_name(0),
          },
          stdin = true,
        }
      end,
    },
    -- Other filetypes (e.g., JavaScript, Rust) with their formatters
  },
  format_on_save = {
    timeout_ms = 500,
    lsp_fallback = true,
  },
})
```

### Testing the Configuration

1. Open a Markdown file (`.md`) in Neovim.
2. Run the format command (e.g., `:Format` if using `conform.nvim`, or
   `vim.lsp.buf.format()` if manually formatting via LSP).
3. Verify that `dprint` formats the file. You can check the output or use
   `:messages` to see if there are any errors.
4. If formatting doesn’t work, ensure `dprint` is in your PATH and the
   `dprint.json` config includes Markdown support.

### Troubleshooting

If `dprint` doesn’t work as expected:

1. **Check `dprint` Installation**:
   - Run `dprint fmt --stdin < test.md` in your terminal with a sample Markdown
     file to confirm `dprint` works outside Neovim.
   - If it fails, ensure the Markdown plugin is installed (run
     `dprint config
     update` to fetch plugins defined in `dprint.json`).

2. **Check Neovim Errors**:
   - Use `:messages` or enable verbose logging for your formatter plugin to see
     if there are errors when running `dprint`.

3. **Path Issues**:
   - If Neovim can’t find `dprint`, specify the full path in `exe` (e.g.,
     `exe =
     "/usr/local/bin/dprint"` or wherever it’s installed).

4. **Configuration File**:
   - Ensure `dprint.json` is in your project root or a parent directory, or
     specify a global config path with `dprint --config /path/to/dprint.json`.

### Customizing `dprint` for Markdown

Unlike Prettier, which uses command-line flags like `--prose-wrap`, `dprint`
relies on its configuration file for formatting rules. Adjust `dprint.json` to
match your desired Markdown style. Common options for Markdown include:

- `textWrap`: `"always"`, `"never"`, or `"maintain"` (controls prose wrapping).
- `lineWidth`: Integer (maximum line length for wrapped text).
- `emphasisKind`: `"asterisk"` or `"underscore"` (for bold/italic).
- `strongKind`: Same as above.

Example `dprint.json` for Markdown similar to Prettier’s behavior:

```json
{
  "incremental": true,
  "includes": ["**/*.md"],
  "excludes": [],
  "plugins": ["https://plugins.dprint.dev/markdown-0.17.8.wasm"],
  "markdown": {
    "textWrap": "always",
    "lineWidth": 80,
    "emphasisKind": "asterisk",
    "strongKind": "asterisk"
  }
}
```

### Final Notes

This configuration should successfully switch your Markdown formatting from
Prettier to `dprint` in Neovim. Ensure `dprint` is installed, accessible, and
configured with a `dprint.json` file that includes Markdown support. If you’re
using a different formatter plugin or encounter issues, let me know, and I’ll
adjust the instructions accordingly. Also, if you want to apply `dprint` to
other filetypes (e.g., JSON, JavaScript), you can extend the `formatters_by_ft`
table for those as well, provided `dprint` supports them with the appropriate
plugins.

Let me know if you run into any problems or need help with additional `dprint`
configuration!

i have a question about buffers in neovim. sometimes, i open a new buffer in the
current window. suddenly, the old buffer i had is lost. i have a few questions
about this:

1. is there a memory of the previous buffer, like "back" in a web browser?
2. is "back" functionality available by default somehow?
3. can i add a keybinding to make going back easy?
4. what about going forward? can i go "back" and "forward" exactly like a web
   browser?

# === ASSISTANT ===

I'm happy to help clarify how buffers work in Neovim and address your questions
about navigating between buffers, including "back" and "forward" functionality
similar to a web browser. Let's dive into the behavior you're experiencing and
answer each of your questions systematically.

### Understanding Buffer Behavior in Neovim

In Neovim (and Vim), a **buffer** is an in-memory representation of a file or
content that you're editing. When you open a new buffer in the current window
(e.g., using `:e filename` or a plugin like a file explorer), the new buffer
replaces the content displayed in that window, but the old buffer is **not
lost**—it remains in memory unless explicitly closed (e.g., with `:bd` for
"buffer delete"). The old buffer is still accessible; it’s just not visible in
the current window.

The behavior you're describing—where the old buffer seems "lost"—is simply
because the window now shows a different buffer. Neovim keeps track of all open
buffers, and you can switch between them using various commands.

Now, let's address your specific questions about navigating buffer history.

---

### 1. Is there a memory of the previous buffer, like "back" in a web browser?

**Yes**, Neovim maintains a memory of buffers you've viewed in a window through
a mechanism called the **jump list** and **change list**, though these are not
exactly like a web browser's "back" history. More relevant to your question,
Neovim also tracks the order in which buffers are displayed in a window via the
**buffer list** and **alternate buffer**.

- **Alternate Buffer**: Neovim remembers the last buffer you were viewing in a
  window before switching to the current one. This is accessible via the
  alternate buffer, denoted by `#` in commands like `:ls` (list buffers). You
  can switch to the alternate buffer with `:b#` or `<C-^>` (Control-6 by
  default).
- **Buffer List**: All open buffers are listed with `:ls` or `:buffers`, and you
  can navigate to any of them by number or name (e.g., `:b3` for buffer 3).
- **Jump List**: Neovim maintains a jump list (`:jumps`) that records cursor
  positions across buffers and files when you perform jumps (like `gg`, `G`, or
  following a tag with `<C-]>`. You can navigate this with `<C-o>` (back) and
  `<C-i>` (forward), but it’s more about cursor positions than strictly buffer
  history.

While these mechanisms provide a way to revisit previous buffers, they don’t
offer a strict "back/forward" stack like a web browser by default for buffer
navigation. However, the alternate buffer (`<C-^>`) often feels like a "back"
action since it toggles between the current and previous buffer in the window.

---

### 2. Is "back" functionality available by default somehow?

**Yes**, there are default ways to access the previously viewed buffer in
Neovim, though it’s not labeled as "back" in the same sense as a web browser:

- **Alternate Buffer with `<C-^>` (Control-6)**: This keybinding toggles between
  the current buffer and the last buffer displayed in the current window. It’s
  the closest default behavior to a "back" action for buffer navigation.
  - Example: If you’re viewing `file1.txt`, switch to `file2.txt` with
    `:e
    file2.txt`, then press `<C-^>`, you’ll go back to `file1.txt`. Press
    `<C-^>` again to return to `file2.txt`.
- **Jump List with `<C-o>`**: If switching buffers involved a jump (e.g., using
  `:bnext` or opening a file via a tag), `<C-o>` will take you back to the
  previous cursor position, which might be in the previous buffer. `<C-i>` moves
  forward in the jump list.
- **Buffer Navigation Commands**: Commands like `:bprevious` (or `:bp`) and
  `:bnext` (or `:bn`) cycle through the buffer list, but they don’t strictly
  follow a "history" order; they follow the order buffers were opened or their
  buffer numbers.

The alternate buffer toggle (`<C-^>`) is the most straightforward default "back"
functionality for switching between the last two buffers in a window.

---

### 3. Can I add a keybinding to make going back easy?

**Yes**, you can add a custom keybinding to switch to the previous buffer (or
alternate buffer) easily. Since `<C-^>` is the default way to toggle between the
current and alternate buffer, you can remap it to a more convenient key if
desired.

Here’s how to set a keybinding for "back" to the previous buffer using Lua in
your Neovim configuration (e.g., in `init.lua`):

```lua
vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>b', '<C-^>', { noremap = true, silent = true, desc = 'Go back to previous buffer' })
```

- `<Leader>b`: Maps to a leader key followed by `b` (for "back" or "buffer").
  Adjust this to any key you prefer (e.g., `<C-b>` or `gb`).
- `<C-^>`: The command to toggle to the alternate buffer (previous buffer in the
  window).
- `noremap = true`: Ensures the mapping doesn’t trigger other mappings.
- `silent = true`: Suppresses command output.
- `desc`: Optional description for the mapping (useful for plugins like
  `which-key.nvim`).

If you prefer using Vimscript (e.g., in a `.vim` file or mixed config):

```vim
nnoremap <silent> <Leader>b <C-^>
```

This makes going "back" to the previous buffer as easy as pressing `<Leader>b`.

---

### 4. What about going forward? Can I go "back" and "forward" exactly like a web browser?

**Partially, but not exactly by default.** Neovim doesn’t maintain a strict
linear "back/forward" history stack for buffer navigation like a web browser out
of the box. However, you can approximate this behavior with existing features
and custom mappings, or use a plugin for more browser-like navigation.

#### Default Behavior for "Forward"

- Since `<C-^>` toggles between the current and alternate buffer, it serves as
  both "back" and "forward" for the last two buffers viewed in a window. If you
  press `<C-^>` to go "back" to the previous buffer, pressing it again acts as
  "forward" to return to the buffer you just left.
- The jump list provides a more general "back" and "forward" for cursor
  positions across buffers:
  - `<C-o>`: Go back to the previous position in the jump list (often in a
    previous buffer if a jump crossed buffers).
  - `<C-i>`: Go forward to the next position in the jump list.
- Commands like `:bnext` (`:bn`) and `:bprevious` (`:bp`) cycle through the
  buffer list, but they don’t respect the order in which you viewed buffers;
  they follow buffer numbers or the order buffers were opened.

#### Limitations of Default Behavior

- The alternate buffer (`<C-^>`) only remembers the last buffer, not a full
  history stack. If you switch to a third buffer, the alternate buffer updates,
  and you lose direct access to the earlier one in the toggle.
- The jump list (`<C-o>` and `<C-i>`) tracks cursor positions, not strictly
  buffer history, so it might not behave exactly like a browser’s history if
  your navigation doesn’t involve jumps.

#### Adding "Back" and "Forward" Keybindings

Since `<C-^>` toggles between two buffers, you can map "back" and "forward" to
the same key if you’re only concerned with the last two buffers. However, for a
more browser-like experience with a full history, you’ll need a plugin (see
below). For now, let’s map "back" and "forward" using the alternate buffer
toggle and jump list:

```lua
-- Map "back" to alternate buffer (previous buffer in window)
vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>b', '<C-^>', { noremap = true, silent = true, desc = 'Go back to previous buffer' })

-- Map "forward" using jump list (or reuse <C-^> for simplicity with alternate buffer)
vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>f', '<C-i>', { noremap = true, silent = true, desc = 'Go forward in jump list' })

-- Optionally, map "back" in jump list for completeness
vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>B', '<C-o>', { noremap = true, silent = true, desc = 'Go back in jump list' })
```

- `<Leader>b`: Goes "back" to the previous buffer via alternate buffer toggle.
- `<Leader>f`: Goes "forward" in the jump list (if applicable; otherwise, you
  can map it to `<C-^>` again for simplicity with alternate buffer).
- `<Leader>B`: Goes "back" in the jump list for cursor positions.

#### Achieving Web Browser-Like "Back/Forward" with a Plugin

To get a true web browser-like "back/forward" history for buffer navigation
(where you can traverse a full stack of buffers viewed in a window), you’ll need
a plugin. Neovim doesn’t track buffer history in a linear stack by default, but
plugins can add this functionality.

One popular plugin for this is **bufferline.nvim** (for tab-like buffer
management) combined with custom history tracking, or a dedicated history
plugin. Alternatively, you can use a simple plugin like **vim-bufsurf** or write
a small Lua script to track buffer history.

Here’s a recommendation for a lightweight approach using **vim-bufsurf** (a Vim
plugin that works in Neovim):

1. Install `vim-bufsurf` using your plugin manager. For example, with
   `packer.nvim`:
   ```lua
   use 'ton/vim-bufsurf'
   ```
   Or with `lazy.nvim`:
   ```lua
   { 'ton/vim-bufsurf' }
   ```

2. `vim-bufsurf` adds "back" and "forward" commands for buffer history:
   - `:BufSurfBack` (go back in buffer history).
   - `:BufSurfForward` (go forward in buffer history).

3. Map these commands to custom keybindings in your config:
   ```lua
   vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>b', ':BufSurfBack<CR>', { noremap = true, silent = true, desc = 'Go back in buffer history' })
   vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>f', ':BufSurfForward<CR>', { noremap = true, silent = true, desc = 'Go forward in buffer history' })
   ```

This setup gives you a browser-like history stack for buffers, where Neovim
remembers the sequence of buffers you’ve viewed in a window and lets you
navigate back and forward through that history.

#### Alternative: Custom Lua Script for Buffer History

If you don’t want a plugin, you can write a small Lua script to track buffer
history per window. Here’s a basic example (though a plugin like `vim-bufsurf`
is recommended for robustness):

```lua
-- Simple buffer history tracking per window
local buffer_history = {}
local current_index = {}

-- Initialize history for a window if not exists
local function init_history(win_id)
  if not buffer_history[win_id] then
    buffer_history[win_id] = {}
    current_index[win_id] = 0
  end
end

-- Add buffer to history when switching
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd("BufWinEnter", {
  callback = function()
    local win_id = vim.api.nvim_get_current_win()
    local buf_id = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
    init_history(win_id)
    -- Only add if it's a new buffer in history or after current index
    if current_index[win_id] < #buffer_history[win_id] then
      buffer_history[win_id] = vim.list_slice(buffer_history[win_id], 1, current_index[win_id])
    end
    table.insert(buffer_history[win_id], buf_id)
    current_index[win_id] = #buffer_history[win_id]
  end,
})

-- Go back in history
local function go_back()
  local win_id = vim.api.nvim_get_current_win()
  init_history(win_id)
  if current_index[win_id] > 1 then
    current_index[win_id] = current_index[win_id] - 1
    vim.api.nvim_win_set_buf(win_id, buffer_history[win_id][current_index[win_id]])
  end
end

-- Go forward in history
local function go_forward()
  local win_id = vim.api.nvim_get_current_win()
  init_history(win_id)
  if current_index[win_id] < #buffer_history[win_id] then
    current_index[win_id] = current_index[win_id] + 1
    vim.api.nvim_win_set_buf(win_id, buffer_history[win_id][current_index[win_id]])
  end
end

-- Map keys for back and forward
vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>b', go_back, { noremap = true, silent = true, desc = 'Go back in buffer history' })
vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>f', go_forward, { noremap = true, silent = true, desc = 'Go forward in buffer history' })
```

This script tracks buffer history per window and allows navigation with "back"
and "forward" keybindings. It’s a basic implementation and might need refinement
for edge cases (e.g., buffer deletion), which is why a plugin like `vim-bufsurf`
is often preferable.

---

### Summary of Answers

1. **Is there a memory of the previous buffer?**
   - Yes, via the alternate buffer (accessible with `<C-^>`) and jump list
     (`<C-o>` and `<C-i>`). A full history stack isn’t built-in but can be added
     with plugins or scripts.

2. **Is "back" functionality available by default?**
   - Yes, `<C-^>` toggles to the previous buffer in the window, and `<C-o>` goes
     back in the jump list for cursor positions.

3. **Can I add a keybinding for going back?**
   - Yes, map a key like `<Leader>b` to `<C-^>` for simple back navigation, or
     use a plugin/script for full history.

4. **Can I go "back" and "forward" like a web browser?**
   - Partially with `<C-^>` for toggling between two buffers, or with `<C-o>`
     and `<C-i>` for jump list navigation. For a true browser-like history
     stack, use a plugin like `vim-bufsurf` or a custom script.

### Final Recommendation

For the simplest solution, start with mapping `<Leader>b` to `<C-^>` for
"back/forward" toggling between the last two buffers. If you need a full history
stack like a web browser, install `vim-bufsurf` and map `:BufSurfBack` and
`:BufSurfForward` to your preferred keys.

Here’s a minimal config to get started without a plugin:

```lua
vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>b', '<C-^>', { noremap = true, silent = true, desc = 'Toggle previous buffer (back/forward)' })
```

If you want the full browser-like experience, add `vim-bufsurf` as described
above. Let me know if you’d like help setting up a specific plugin or refining
the custom script!

i use a tool called `mhartington/formatter.nvim` to format my code and text
files. it's a great tool, but has a problem with large files. when formatting a
large file, it blocks the main thread, and the entire app freezes while it is
formatting. this leads me to think there is a problem with this tool running the
formatter in the main thread. i know nvim/lua has good support for asynchronous
operations. i'm curious about ways to fix this. i have several questions.

1. is there another formatter calling external tools that supports asynchronous
   formats, showing a spinner while formatting?
2. is there any way to wrap this tool in a separate asynchronous call, showing a
   spinner while it formats?
3. how difficult would it be to fork this tool and add asynchronous support to
   it? it would be exactly the same, except it would be asynchronous and run a
   spinner while formatting.

here is my current configuration:

```lua

I'm glad you're finding `mhartington/formatter.nvim` useful for formatting
your code and text files in Neovim. You're correct that the issue of freezing on
large files is likely due to the formatter running synchronously on the main
thread, which blocks the UI during the operation. Neovim does have excellent
support for asynchronous operations via its `vim.loop` API and other mechanisms,
and there are ways to address this issue. Let's tackle each of your questions
about asynchronous formatting and potential solutions.

### Overview of the Problem

`mhartington/formatter.nvim` (as of its latest versions at the time of this
response) runs external formatting tools synchronously by default, which means
that when formatting a large file, Neovim waits for the external process (e.g.,
`black`, `prettier`, `rustfmt`) to complete before updating the buffer and
returning control to the user. This results in the UI freezing, especially for
large files or slow formatters. Fortunately, there are alternatives and
workarounds to make formatting asynchronous, including showing a spinner or
progress indicator.

I'll address each of your questions in detail.

---

### 1. Is there another formatter calling external tools that supports asynchronous formats, showing a spinner while formatting?

**Yes**, there are alternative formatter plugins for Neovim that support
asynchronous formatting and can display a spinner or progress indicator during
the operation. One of the most popular and actively maintained options is
**`stevearc/conform.nvim`**, which is designed to run formatters asynchronously
by default and integrates well with Neovim's modern Lua ecosystem.

#### About `conform.nvim`
- **Asynchronous by Default**: `conform.nvim` uses Neovim's `vim.loop` to run
  external formatting tools asynchronously, preventing the UI from freezing even
  on large files.
- **Progress Feedback**: It supports showing notifications or progress
  indicators via integration with plugins like `nvim-notify` or Neovim's built-in
  status line updates (though a spinner might require additional setup or a
  plugin like `fidget.nvim` for LSP-like progress spinners).
- **Highly Configurable**: It supports multiple formatters per filetype, LSP
  fallback, and custom configurations similar to `formatter.nvim`.

#### Setup with `conform.nvim`
To switch to `conform.nvim`, you can adapt your current configuration. Here's an
example of how to migrate your setup:

```lua
{
  "stevearc/conform.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("conform").setup({
      formatters_by_ft = {

              return { "deno_fmt" }
            else
              return { "biome" }
            end
          end,
        },
        typescriptreact = {
          function(bufnr)
            if vim.fn.filereadable(vim.fn.findfile("deno.json", ".;") or vim.fn.findfile("deno.jsonc", ".;")) == 1 then
              return { "deno_fmt" }
            else
              return { "biome" }
            end
          end,
        },
        javascript = {

              return { "deno_fmt" }
            else
              return { "biome" }
            end
          end,
        },
        javascriptreact = {
          function(bufnr)
            if vim.fn.filereadable(vim.fn.findfile("deno.json", ".;") or vim.fn.findfile("deno.jsonc", ".;")) == 1 then

          args = function(self, ctx)
            local config_path = vim.fn.findfile("biome.json", vim.fn.fnamemodify(ctx.filename, ":h") .. ";")
            if config_path == "" then
              config_path = vim.fn.fnamemodify(ctx.filename, ":h")
            else
              config_path = vim.fn.fnamemodify(config_path, ":h")
            end
            return {

              config_path,

              ctx.filename,
            }
          end,

        },

          stdin = true,
        },
        rustfmt = {

          command = "wgsl_analyzer",
          args = { "format" },
          stdin = true,
        },
      },
    })
  end,
},
```

#### Adding a Spinner with `fidget.nvim`
To show a spinner or progress indicator while formatting, you can pair
`conform.nvim` with a plugin like `j-hui/fidget.nvim`, which displays
progress notifications for asynchronous tasks (originally designed for LSP but
works with other async operations via custom integration). While `conform.nvim`
doesn't natively show a spinner, you can hook into its events to display
progress:

1. Install `fidget.nvim`:
   ```lua
   { "j-hui/fidget.nvim", tag = "legacy", opts = {} }
   ```

2. Use `conform.nvim` events to show a spinner (requires a custom wrapper or
   listening to formatting start/end events, which might need a small script or
   PR to `conform.nvim` for better event support). For now, `fidget.nvim` works
   best with LSP, so you might see progress via LSP fallback formatting.

Alternatively, `conform.nvim` can display notifications via `vim.notify` if you
enable it, though it’s not a spinner by default.

#### Why Switch?
Switching to `conform.nvim` is likely the easiest and most sustainable solution.
It’s actively maintained, supports async formatting out of the box, and has a
similar configuration style to `formatter.nvim`, making migration
straightforward as shown above.

---

### 2. Is there any way to wrap this tool in a separate asynchronous call, showing a spinner while it formats?

**Yes**, you can wrap `mhartington/formatter.nvim` in an asynchronous call to
prevent blocking the main thread, though this requires modifying how the
formatter is invoked since `formatter.nvim` itself does not natively support
asynchronous execution in its current design (as of the latest version). You can
achieve this by overriding the formatting behavior with Neovim’s `vim.loop` API
to run the external formatter process asynchronously, and you can display a
spinner or progress indicator during the operation.

#### Approach to Make `formatter.nvim` Asynchronous
`formatter.nvim` allows custom formatter definitions, but its internal execution
of the `exe` command (via `vim.fn.jobstart` or similar) is synchronous by
default. To make it asynchronous:

1. **Override the Formatter Execution**: Use a custom wrapper around the
   formatter configuration to run the external command asynchronously with
   `vim.loop.new_async()` or `vim.fn.jobstart` with proper callbacks.
2. **Show a Spinner**: Use a plugin like `j-hui/fidget.nvim` or a custom
   `vim.notify` message with a spinner animation while the async job runs.

However, directly modifying `formatter.nvim`’s behavior without forking it is
challenging because its core logic isn’t designed for async callbacks. A simpler
workaround is to create a custom command or wrapper function that intercepts the
formatting request and runs it asynchronously.

Here’s a basic example of wrapping a formatter in an async call (this is a
proof-of-concept and may need integration with `formatter.nvim`’s internals):

```lua
local function async_format(formatter_config)
  local bufnr = vim.api.nvim_get_current_buf()
  local content = vim.api.nvim_buf_get_lines(bufnr, 0, -1, false)
  local input = table.concat(content, "\n")
  local output = ""

  -- Show a spinner or notification
  vim.notify("Formatting...", vim.log.levels.INFO, { title = "Formatter", timeout = false })

  -- Run the formatter asynchronously using vim.loop
  local handle = vim.loop.spawn(formatter_config.exe, {
    args = formatter_config.args,
    stdio = { nil, nil, nil }, -- We'll handle stdin/stdout manually if needed
  }, function(code, signal)
    if code == 0 then
      vim.schedule(function()
        -- Apply the formatted output to the buffer
        local lines = vim.split(output, "\n")
        vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(bufnr, 0, -1, false, lines)
        vim.notify("Formatting complete!", vim.log.levels.INFO, { title = "Formatter" })
      end)
    else
      vim.schedule(function()
        vim.notify("Formatting failed with code " .. code, vim.log.levels.ERROR, { title = "Formatter" })
      end)
    end
    handle:close()
  end)

  -- Write input to stdin if the formatter supports it
  if formatter_config.stdin then
    handle:write(input)
    handle:write(nil) -- Close stdin
  end

  -- Read stdout
  handle:read_start(function(err, data)
    if err then
      vim.schedule(function()
        vim.notify("Error reading formatter output: " .. err, vim.log.levels.ERROR, { title = "Formatter" })
      end)
    elseif data then
      output = output .. data
    end
  end)
end
```

This is a rough sketch and would need to be integrated with `formatter.nvim`’s
configuration and event system. A full implementation would involve overriding
the default `Format` command or hooking into the plugin’s internals, which is
non-trivial without forking.

#### Spinner Implementation
For a spinner, you can use a plugin like `j-hui/fidget.nvim` or animate a simple
`vim.notify` message with a timer to update a spinner character (e.g., `|`, `/`,
`-`, `\`) while the async job runs. This requires additional scripting and isn’t
built into `formatter.nvim`.

**Challenges**:
- Integrating this async wrapper with `formatter.nvim` without forking the
  plugin is complex because you’d need to override its default synchronous
  behavior.
- A better approach might be switching to `conform.nvim` as described in
  question 1, which already handles async formatting natively.

---

### 3. How difficult would it be to fork this tool and add asynchronous support to it? It would be exactly the same, except it would be asynchronous and run a spinner while formatting.

**Forking `mhartington/formatter.nvim` and adding asynchronous support is
feasible but involves moderate effort**, depending on your familiarity with Lua
and Neovim’s API. Here’s an assessment of the difficulty and steps involved:

#### Difficulty Level
- **Moderate**: If you’re comfortable with Lua programming and Neovim’s
  asynchronous APIs (`vim.loop`, `vim.fn.jobstart`), forking and modifying the
  plugin is a reasonable task. The core logic of `formatter.nvim` is
  straightforward—it constructs a command from `exe` and `args`, runs it, and
  applies the output to the buffer. Changing this to use asynchronous job
  control is a focused change.
- **Time Estimate**: For someone with intermediate Lua/Neovim experience, this
  could take a few hours to a day to implement and test basic async support.
  Adding a spinner or progress UI might add another hour or two.

#### Steps to Fork and Modify
1. **Fork the Repository**:
   - Clone the `mhartington/formatter.nvim` repository from GitHub
     (`https://github.com/mhartington/formatter.nvim`).
   - Create your own fork or local branch to work on.

2. **Understand the Code**:
   - The core of `formatter.nvim` is in `lua/formatter/init.lua` and related
     files. Look for the function that executes the formatter (likely using
     `vim.fn.system` or similar for synchronous execution).
   - Identify where the `Format` command is defined and how it calls the
     formatter.

3. **Replace Synchronous Execution with Asynchronous**:
   - Replace calls to `vim.fn.system` (or equivalent) with `vim.fn.jobstart` or
     `vim.loop.spawn` to run the formatter process asynchronously.
   - Use callbacks or `vim.schedule` to update the buffer with the formatter’s
     output once the job completes.
   - Here’s a pseudo-code example of the change:
     ```lua
     -- Old synchronous call (example)
     local result = vim.fn.system(formatter_cmd)
     vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(bufnr, 0, -1, false, vim.split(result, "\n"))

     -- New asynchronous call
     vim.fn.jobstart(formatter_cmd, {
       stdout_buffered = true,
       on_stdout = function(_, data)
         vim.schedule(function()
           vim.api.nvim_buf_set_lines(bufnr, 0, -1, false, data)
         end)
       end,
       on_exit = function(_, code)
         vim.schedule(function()
           if code == 0 then
             vim.notify("Formatting complete!", vim.log.levels.INFO)
           else
             vim.notify("Formatting failed!", vim.log.levels.ERROR)
           end
         end)
       end,
     })
     ```

4. **Add a Spinner or Progress Indicator**:
   - Integrate a spinner using `vim.notify` with a timer to animate characters
     (e.g., `|`, `/`, `-`, `\`), or use a plugin like `fidget.nvim` to show
     progress.
   - Start the spinner before the job begins and stop it in the `on_exit`
     callback.

5. **Test the Changes**:
   - Test with small and large files across different formatters (`black`,
     `dprint`, etc.) to ensure async behavior works without freezing.
   - Handle edge cases like formatter errors, timeouts, and buffer updates.

6. **Publish or Use Locally**:
   - If successful, you can publish your fork as a new plugin (e.g.,
     `yourname/async-formatter.nvim`) or use it locally by pointing your plugin
     manager to your forked repository or local path.

#### Challenges
- **Error Handling**: Ensuring proper error handling for async jobs (e.g.,
  timeouts, crashed formatters) adds complexity.
- **Compatibility**: Maintaining compatibility with existing `formatter.nvim`
  configs (like your complex conditional logic for `deno` vs. `biome`) requires
  careful testing.
- **Spinner UI**: Implementing a smooth spinner or progress UI in Neovim
  requires additional scripting for animation or integration with a UI plugin.

#### Recommendation
Forking and modifying `formatter.nvim` is a good learning exercise if you’re
interested in Neovim plugin development, but it might not be the most efficient
solution given that `conform.nvim` already offers async support with a similar
feature set. If you decide to fork, start with a minimal change to make one
formatter async (e.g., `black` for Python) and expand from there.

---

### Final Recommendations

1. **Easiest Solution (Switch to `conform.nvim`)**:
   - I strongly recommend switching to `conform.nvim` as outlined in question 1.
     It’s async by default, actively maintained, and supports your complex
     conditional formatter logic (e.g., `deno` vs. `biome`). Pair it with
     `fidget.nvim` or `vim.notify` for progress feedback. This avoids the need
     to fork or hack `formatter.nvim`.

2. **Wrapping `formatter.nvim` in Async Call**:
   - Wrapping `formatter.nvim` in a custom async call is possible but requires
     significant scripting to override its default behavior. It’s less practical
     than switching to a natively async plugin like `conform.nvim`.

3. **Forking `formatter.nvim`**:
   - Forking and adding async support is a moderate-effort task if you’re
     comfortable with Lua and Neovim’s API. It’s a viable option if you’re
     attached to `formatter.nvim`’s specific workflow and want to contribute
     back to the community, but it’s likely overkill given existing
     alternatives.

### Next Steps
- **Try `conform.nvim` First**: Install and configure `conform.nvim` as shown
  above. Test it with a large file to confirm it doesn’t block the UI. Add
  `fidget.nvim` or a custom `vim.notify` for visual feedback.
- **Fallback to Forking**: If `conform.nvim` doesn’t meet your needs (e.g., due
  to specific `formatter.nvim` features you rely on), consider forking and
  modifying `formatter.nvim`. I can help with specific code changes or PR
  guidance if you choose this path.

Let me know if you’d like a more detailed setup for `conform.nvim`, help with
forking `formatter.nvim`, or a custom async wrapper script. I’m happy to assist
further!

ok, i agree that switching to `conform.nvim` is the best option. however, before i do that, i suspect i can clean up my current config to be better before switching. notice the "find file in cwd parents" function i created. i isn't there a function in neovim that does this already? doesn't it have some sort of pattern matching code to find files up in parent directories?

```lua
  -- Code formatting (":Format" command)
  {
    "mhartington/formatter.nvim",
    config = function()
      local uv = vim.loop -- Use Neovim's built-in libuv wrapper for filesystem operations

      -- Function to recursively search for a file in the current directory or any parent directory
      local function find_file_in_cwd_parents(filename)
        ---@diagnostic disable-next-line: undefined-field
        local cwd = uv.cwd() -- Get the current working directory

        while cwd do
          local filepath = cwd .. "/" .. filename
          ---@diagnostic disable-next-line: undefined-field
          local stat = uv.fs_stat(filepath)
          if stat then
            return true -- File found
          end

          -- Move to the parent directory
          local parent = cwd:match("(.*/)[^/]+/?$")
          if parent == cwd then
            break -- Reached the root directory
          end
          cwd = parent
        end

        return false -- File not found in any parent directory
      end

      -- Function to search for a file (filename) in the directory of another file (full_path)
      -- and recursively in its parent directories.
      local function find_file_in_file_parents(filename, full_path)
        -- Get the directory of the file passed in as full_path
        local dir = vim.fn.fnamemodify(full_path, ":h") -- ":h" extracts the directory from full_path
        --print("Starting search in directory: " .. dir)

        while dir do
          local filepath = dir .. "/" .. filename
          --print("Checking for file at: " .. filepath) -- Debug print

          local stat = vim.loop.fs_stat(filepath)
          if stat then
            print("File found: " .. filepath) -- Debug print when file is found
            return filepath -- Return the absolute file path if found
          end

          -- Move to the parent directory
          local parent = dir:match("(.*/)[^/]+/?$")
          if not parent or parent == dir then
            --print("Reached root directory, stopping search.") -- Debug print
            break -- Reached the root directory
          end

          --print("Moving to parent directory: " .. parent) -- Debug print for parent
          dir = parent
        end

        print("File not found.") -- Debug print when file is not found
        return nil -- File not found
      end

You're right to consider cleaning up your current configuration before
switching to `conform.nvim`. Simplifying and leveraging built-in Neovim
functionality will make the transition smoother and your config more
maintainable. Let's address your question about whether Neovim has built-in
functions for searching for files in parent directories, and then I'll help
refactor your configuration to use those utilities. After that, I'll provide an
updated configuration for `conform.nvim` based on the cleaned-up version.

### Does Neovim Have Built-in Functions for Finding Files in Parent Directories?

**Yes**, Neovim (and Vim) provides built-in functions and utilities to search
for files in the current directory or parent directories, so you don't need to
write custom functions like `find_file_in_cwd_parents` or
`find_file_in_file_parents`. Here are the relevant tools:

1. **`vim.fn.findfile()`**:
   - This function searches for a file in the current directory and upward
     through parent directories. It uses the `path` option (or a custom path) to
     determine where to search.
   - Syntax: `vim.fn.findfile(name, path)`
     - `name`: The filename or pattern to search for (e.g., `deno.json`).
     - `path`: A string like `.;` (start from current directory and go up) or a
       specific path.
   - Returns: The full path to the file if found, or an empty string if not
     found.
   - Example:
     ```lua
     local deno_config = vim.fn.findfile("deno.json", ".;")
     if deno_config ~= "" then
       -- File found, use Deno formatter
     end
     ```

2. **`vim.fn.filereadable()`**:
   - Checks if a file exists and is readable. While it doesn't search parent
     directories on its own, you can combine it with `vim.fn.findfile()` to
     confirm a file’s existence.
   - Example:
     ```lua
     if vim.fn.filereadable(vim.fn.findfile("deno.json", ".;")) == 1 then
       -- File exists and is readable
     end
     ```

3. **`lspconfig.util.root_pattern()`** (from `nvim-lspconfig`)**:
   - If you're already using `nvim-lspconfig` for LSP configurations, it
     provides `lspconfig.util.root_pattern()` which searches for files or
     directories (like `deno.json`, `biome.json`, etc.) upward from the current
     file’s directory to determine a project root. This is very similar to what
     your custom functions do.
   - While primarily used for LSP root directory detection, you can use it for
     formatter selection as well.
   - Example:
     ```lua
     local lspconfig = require('lspconfig')
     local root_dir = lspconfig.util.root_pattern('deno.json', 'deno.jsonc')(vim.fn.expand('%:p:h'))
     if root_dir then
       -- Deno project detected
     end
     ```

4. **`vim.fn.fnamemodify()`**:
   - This is already used in your `find_file_in_file_parents` function to get
     the directory of a file (`:h` modifier). It’s a powerful built-in for path
     manipulation and works well with other functions like `vim.fn.findfile()`.

### Why Use Built-in Functions?
Using `vim.fn.findfile()` or `lspconfig.util.root_pattern()` instead of custom
functions like `find_file_in_cwd_parents` and `find_file_in_file_parents` has
several advantages:
- **Simplicity**: Reduces code duplication and potential bugs in custom logic.
- **Performance**: Built-in functions are optimized and often faster than manual
  directory traversal in Lua.
- **Maintainability**: Leverages Neovim’s standard APIs, making your config
  easier to understand and maintain.

### Refactoring Your Current Configuration
Let’s refactor your configuration for `mhartington/formatter.nvim` by replacing
your custom file-search functions with `vim.fn.findfile()`. This will simplify
the logic for detecting project types (e.g., Deno vs. Biome).

Here’s the cleaned-up version of your current config:

```lua

  "mhartington/formatter.nvim",

```

### Explanation of Changes
- **Removed Custom Functions**: Replaced `find_file_in_cwd_parents` and
  `find_file_in_file_parents` with `vim.fn.findfile("filename", ".;")`, which
  searches upward from the current file’s directory or working directory.
- **Simplified Logic**: Used `vim.fn.fnamemodify(path, ":h")` to extract the
  directory of a found config file (e.g., `biome.json`) for use in
  `--config-path`.
- **Fallback Path**: If a config file like `biome.json` is not found, the
  current file’s directory is used as a fallback for `--config-path`, ensuring
  the formatter doesn’t fail.

This refactoring removes over 50 lines of custom code while maintaining the same
functionality. It leverages Neovim’s built-in file search capabilities, making
the config cleaner and less prone to bugs.

### Transition to `conform.nvim`
Now that your config is simplified, transitioning to `conform.nvim` (which
supports asynchronous formatting) is straightforward. `conform.nvim` uses a
similar structure for defining formatters per filetype and supports dynamic
formatter selection via functions. Below is your configuration adapted to
`conform.nvim`:

```lua
{
  "stevearc/conform.nvim",
  config = function()
    require("conform").setup({
      formatters_by_ft = {
        markdown = { "dprint" },
        toml = { "dprint" },
        typescript = {
          function(bufnr)
            if vim.fn.findfile("deno.json", ".;") ~= "" or vim.fn.findfile("deno.jsonc", ".;") ~= "" then
              return { "deno_fmt" }
            else
              return { "biome" }
            end
          end,
        },
        typescriptreact = {
          function(bufnr)
            if vim.fn.findfile("deno.json", ".;") ~= "" or vim.fn.findfile("deno.jsonc", ".;") ~= "" then

### Explanation of `conform.nvim` Configuration
- **Formatters by Filetype**: Maps filetypes to formatters, using functions for
  conditional logic (e.g., Deno vs. Biome for TypeScript).
- **Custom Formatters**: Defines formatter configurations with `command`, `args`,
  and `stdin`. `conform.nvim` runs these asynchronously by default, preventing
  UI freezing on large files.
- **Format on Save**: Configures automatic formatting on save with a timeout and
  LSP fallback if the formatter fails or times out.
- **Conditional Logic**: Uses `vim.fn.findfile()` for detecting project types,
  maintaining your original logic for selecting formatters.
- **Separate JSON/JSONC for Deno**: Since `deno fmt` for JSON/JSONC doesn’t use
  `stdin` in your config, I created separate formatter entries (`deno_fmt_json`
  and `deno_fmt_jsonc`) with `stdin = false` and used `$FILENAME` placeholder
  provided by `conform.nvim`.

### Adding a Progress Indicator (Optional)
To show a spinner or progress indicator while formatting, you can pair
`conform.nvim` with a plugin like `j-hui/fidget.nvim` for a nice UI feedback
loop, though `conform.nvim` doesn't natively integrate with it for formatting
progress (it’s more LSP-focused). Alternatively, use `vim.notify` for simple
notifications:

1. Install `fidget.nvim` (optional):
   ```lua
   { "j-hui/fidget.nvim", tag = "legacy", opts = {} }
   ```

2. `conform.nvim` can show basic notifications via `vim.notify` if desired, but
   for now, its async nature means you won’t experience freezes, and a spinner
   might be overkill unless formatting takes several seconds.

### Testing the New Setup
1. Replace your `formatter.nvim` plugin entry with the `conform.nvim`
   configuration above in your plugin manager (e.g., `packer.nvim`, `lazy.nvim`).
2. Open a large file (e.g., a large Markdown or Python file) and run `:Format`
   (or save if `format_on_save` is enabled).
3. Confirm that Neovim remains responsive during formatting (no freezing).
4. Use `:LspInfo` or check `vim.notify` messages if there are errors with
   formatter execution.

### Final Notes
By refactoring your config to use `vim.fn.findfile()`, you’ve significantly
simplified the logic for detecting project configuration files like `deno.json`
and `biome.json`. Switching to `conform.nvim` then builds on this clean base,
providing asynchronous formatting to avoid UI freezes on large files. If you
encounter any issues during the transition (e.g., formatter-specific quirks or
progress indicator setup), let me know, and I’ll help debug or refine the
configuration further!
