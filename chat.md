i use rust and clippy and rust-analyzer in neovim. however, something changed recently, and this configuration in my nvim config no longer works:

```lua
          settings = {
            ["rust-analyzer"] = {
              cargo = { allFeatures = true },
              checkOnSave = { command = "clippy" }, -- Run clippy on save
            },
          },
```

the rust_tools.setup method is expecting "checkOnSave" to be a boolean. however, if it is a boolean, how does is know what command to run on save? any idea how to fix?

# === ASSISTANT ===

The issue you're encountering is likely due to a change in the configuration structure or API of `rust-analyzer` or `rust-tools.nvim`. The `checkOnSave` field in the `rust-analyzer` settings used to accept an object with a `command` field to specify the linter (like `clippy`), but this has changed in newer versions of `rust-analyzer` or the associated Neovim LSP setup.

In the current setup, `checkOnSave` is expected to be a boolean in `rust-analyzer` settings, and the command to run (e.g., `clippy`) is configured separately via `rust-analyzer.diagnostics`. Here's how you can fix it.

### Updated Configuration
You can configure `rust-analyzer` to use `clippy` for diagnostics by setting `check.command` instead of `checkOnSave.command`. Here's the corrected configuration for your Neovim setup using `rust-tools.nvim`:

```lua
local rt = require("rust-tools")

rt.setup({
  server = {
    settings = {
      ["rust-analyzer"] = {
        cargo = {
          allFeatures = true,
        },
        check = {
          command = "clippy", -- Use clippy for checking
        },
        checkOnSave = true, -- Enable checking on save
      },
    },
  },
})
```

### Explanation of Changes
1. **`checkOnSave`**: This is now a boolean that simply toggles whether `rust-analyzer` runs a check when you save a file.
2. **`check.command`**: This specifies the command to run for diagnostics. Setting it to `"clippy"` ensures that `clippy` is used for linting and diagnostics when `checkOnSave` is enabled.

### Why Did This Happen?
The `rust-analyzer` configuration schema has evolved over time, and older configurations using `checkOnSave.command` have been deprecated or restructured. The `rust-tools.nvim` plugin now adheres to the updated schema, where `checkOnSave` is a boolean and the command is specified under `check.command`.

### Additional Notes
- If you're using an older version of `rust-tools.nvim` or `rust-analyzer`, you might need to update them to ensure compatibility with the new configuration schema.
- You can check the `rust-analyzer` documentation or the `rust-tools.nvim` repository for the latest configuration options to ensure you're using the correct fields.
- If you want to confirm the settings are applied, you can use Neovim's `:LspInfo` command to inspect the active LSP configuration for `rust-analyzer`.

### Troubleshooting
If this configuration still doesn't work:
1. Ensure that `clippy` is installed and accessible in your PATH. You can install it with:
   ```bash
   rustup component add clippy
   ```
2. Check if `rust-tools.nvim` or your LSP client is outdated. Update your plugins using your Neovim plugin manager (e.g., `PackerSync` or `Lazy`).
3. Look at the LSP logs (`:LspLog`) to see if there are any errors related to `rust-analyzer` configuration.

i updated my rust version recently, and i think the lsp has gotten worse. hard to describe, but i think it's showing me less diagnostics in the editor than before. are there more settings i need to use to make rust analyzer show more diagnostics?

```lua
  {
    "simrat39/rust-tools.nvim",
    dependencies = { "neovim/nvim-lspconfig" },
    config = function()
      local rust_tools = require("rust-tools")

      local opts = { noremap = true, silent = true }

      -- rust: Rust tools setup with rust-analyzer
      rust_tools.setup({
        server = {
          on_attach = function(client, bufnr)
            -- Keybindings for LSP features in Rust files
            vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(
              bufnr,
              "n",
              "gd",

              "n",
              "K",
              "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.hover()<CR>",
              opts
            )
            vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(
              bufnr,
              "n",
              "<Leader>ca",
              "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.code_action()<CR>",
              opts
            )
            vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(

                features = "all", -- Enable all features
              },
              checkOnSave = true

          },
        },
      })
    end,
  },

# === ASSISTANT ===

If you've noticed a decrease in the number of diagnostics shown by `rust-analyzer` in Neovim after updating your Rust version, there are several potential reasons and additional settings you can tweak to ensure you're getting the maximum diagnostics and feedback. Let's go through some common causes and solutions, and I'll suggest additional `rust-analyzer` settings to enhance diagnostic reporting.

### Possible Reasons for Fewer Diagnostics
1. **Rust Version Update**: Updating Rust might have changed the behavior of `clippy` or `rustc`, which `rust-analyzer` relies on for diagnostics. Newer versions of `clippy` might suppress certain warnings by default or require explicit configuration.
2. **Rust-Analyzer or Plugin Update**: If `rust-analyzer` or `rust-tools.nvim` was updated alongside Rust, the configuration schema or default behavior might have changed, leading to fewer diagnostics being shown.
3. **Diagnostics Settings**: By default, `rust-analyzer` might not show all diagnostics (e.g., warnings from dependencies or certain lints) unless explicitly configured.
4. **Neovim LSP Client**: The Neovim LSP client or `rust-tools.nvim` might filter or limit diagnostics display based on severity or other settings.

### Enhancing Diagnostics in Rust-Analyzer
To ensure you're seeing as many diagnostics as possible, you can configure `rust-analyzer` to be more verbose and include diagnostics from `clippy`, dependencies, and other sources. Below is an updated version of your configuration with additional settings to maximize diagnostics.

### Updated Configuration
```lua
{
  "simrat39/rust-tools.nvim",
  dependencies = { "neovim/nvim-lspconfig" },
  config = function()
    local rust_tools = require("rust-tools")

    local opts = { noremap = true, silent = true }

    -- rust: Rust tools setup with rust-analyzer
    rust_tools.setup({
      server = {
        on_attach = function(client, bufnr)
          -- Keybindings for LSP features in Rust files
          vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(
            bufnr,
            "n",
            "gd",
            "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.definition()<CR>",
            opts
          )
          vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(
            bufnr,
            "n",
            "K",
            "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.hover()<CR>",
            opts
          )
          vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(
            bufnr,
            "n",
            "<Leader>ca",
            "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.code_action()<CR>",
            opts
          )
          vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(
            bufnr,
            "n",
            "<Leader>rn",
            "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.rename()<CR>",
            opts
          )
        end,
        settings = {
          ["rust-analyzer"] = {
            cargo = {
              allFeatures = true, -- Build with all features enabled
              features = "all", -- Ensure all features are considered during analysis
            },
            check = {
              command = "clippy", -- Use clippy for checking
              features = "all", -- Enable all features for clippy
              extraArgs = { "--all", "--", "-W", "clippy::all", "-W", "clippy::pedantic" }, -- Enable more clippy lints
            },
            checkOnSave = true, -- Run checks on save
            diagnostics = {
              enable = true, -- Explicitly enable diagnostics
              disabled = {}, -- Don't disable any diagnostics by default
              enableExperimental = true, -- Enable experimental diagnostics (if available)
            },
            rustc = {
              source = "discover", -- Automatically discover rustc source for better diagnostics
            },
          },
        },
      },
    })
  end,
},
```

### Explanation of New Settings
1. **`check.extraArgs`**: This allows you to pass additional arguments to `clippy`. Here, I've added `--all` to check all targets, and `-W clippy::all` and `-W clippy::pedantic` to enable more strict lints. This can surface more warnings and suggestions that might have been suppressed.
2. **`diagnostics.enable` and `diagnostics.disabled`**: Explicitly enabling diagnostics and ensuring no categories are disabled by default helps ensure you're seeing everything `rust-analyzer` can report.
3. **`diagnostics.enableExperimental`**: This enables experimental diagnostics that might not be fully stable but can provide additional feedback.
4. **`rustc.source = "discover"`**: This tells `rust-analyzer` to automatically detect the `rustc` source, which can improve diagnostics by ensuring the correct version of the compiler is used for analysis.

### Additional Steps to Diagnose and Fix
If you're still seeing fewer diagnostics after applying these settings, consider the following steps:

1. **Check Clippy Version and Lints**:
   - Ensure `clippy` is installed and up-to-date:
     ```bash
     rustup component add clippy
     rustup update
     ```
   - Run `clippy` manually on your project to see if it produces more diagnostics than `rust-analyzer` shows:
     ```bash
     cargo clippy --all-features --all -- -W clippy::all -W clippy::pedantic
     ```
   - If `clippy` shows more diagnostics in the terminal, the issue might be with how `rust-analyzer` integrates or filters diagnostics.

2. **Inspect LSP Logs**:
   - Use Neovim's `:LspLog` command to check for errors or warnings from `rust-analyzer`. This can reveal configuration issues or suppressed diagnostics.
   - Look for messages about ignored or filtered diagnostics.

3. **Check Neovim Diagnostic Settings**:
   - Ensure that Neovim's diagnostic display isn't filtering out warnings or info-level diagnostics. You can configure this globally or per-buffer using:
     ```lua
     vim.diagnostic.config({
       virtual_text = true, -- Show diagnostics as virtual text
       signs = true, -- Show signs in the gutter
       underline = true, -- Underline issues
       severity_sort = true, -- Sort by severity
       float = {
         border = "rounded",
         source = "always", -- Show source of diagnostics
       },
     })
     ```
   - If diagnostics are still not showing, ensure no other plugin (like a linter or formatter) is interfering with LSP diagnostics.

4. **Update Rust-Analyzer and Plugins**:
   - Ensure `rust-analyzer` is up-to-date. If you're using a plugin manager like `packer.nvim` or `lazy.nvim`, update all plugins:
     ```lua
     :PackerSync  -- or equivalent for your plugin manager
     ```
   - You can also manually update `rust-analyzer` if installed separately:
     ```bash
     rustup component add rust-analyzer
     ```

5. **Check Project Configuration**:
   - If your project has a `.cargo/config.toml` or `Cargo.toml` with specific `clippy` or `rustc` settings, they might suppress diagnostics. Look for `lint` or `warn` configurations and adjust them to allow more warnings.

6. **Verbose Output**:
   - Temporarily enable verbose logging for `rust-analyzer` to see what it's doing. Add this to your settings:
     ```lua
     ["rust-analyzer"] = {
       trace = {
         server = "verbose", -- Enable verbose logging
       },
     }
     ```
   - Check the logs with `:LspLog` to see if diagnostics are being generated but not displayed.

### Final Notes
- If you're still not seeing the expected diagnostics, consider comparing the behavior with a minimal Neovim configuration to rule out plugin interference.
- You can also test `rust-analyzer` in another editor (like VS Code with the Rust extension) to confirm if the issue is with `rust-analyzer` itself or Neovim's LSP integration.

Let me know if you need help interpreting logs or if the issue persists after trying these settings!

if i wanted to remap `zt` to `zt10<C-y>`, would that be an infinite loop, or would that work?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Remapping `zt` to `zt10<C-y>` in Neovim would **not** result in an infinite loop, and it should work as intended, provided you define the mapping correctly. Let's break down why this is the case and how to implement it.

### Why It Won't Cause an Infinite Loop
In Neovim (and Vim), when you create a mapping for a key or sequence like `zt`, the mapping applies to the user input, not to the internal execution of commands. The `zt` in your mapping on the right-hand side (`zt10<C-y>`) is interpreted as the literal command `zt`, not as a recursive call to your custom mapping. Neovim does not re-evaluate the mapped command through the mapping system unless you explicitly use a recursive mapping (e.g., with `noremap` not being used).

By default, mappings created with `map` are recursive, meaning if `zt` on the right-hand side referred to a custom mapping, it could potentially cause a loop. However, since `zt` is a built-in Vim command (which scrolls the current line to the top of the window), it is not subject to remapping during execution. Thus, `zt` in `zt10<C-y>` will always execute the original built-in behavior of `zt`, not your custom mapping.

Additionally, using `noremap` (or its mode-specific variants like `nnoremap`) ensures that the right-hand side of the mapping is interpreted literally, without considering any other mappings. This further prevents any risk of recursion.

### What `zt10<C-y>` Does
- `zt`: Scrolls the current line to the top of the window.
- `10<C-y>`: Scrolls the view up by 10 lines (since `<C-y>` scrolls up one line by default, and the `10` prefix multiplies the effect).

So, `zt10<C-y>` will first position the current line at the top of the window (`zt`), then scroll the view up by 10 lines (`10<C-y>`), effectively positioning the current line 10 lines below the top of the window after the initial `zt`.

### How to Implement the Mapping
To remap `zt` to `zt10<C-y>`, you can use the following in your Neovim configuration (e.g., in your `init.lua` or equivalent):

```lua
vim.keymap.set('n', 'zt', 'zt10<C-y>', { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

### Explanation of Options
- `'n'`: Applies the mapping in normal mode.
- `noremap = true`: Ensures the right-hand side (`zt10<C-y>`) is not subject to further remapping, though in this case, it’s not strictly necessary since `zt` and `<C-y>` are built-in commands.
- `silent = true`: Prevents the command from being echoed in the command line.

Alternatively, if you're using the older `nvim_buf_set_keymap` or raw Vim commands, you can write it as:

```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', 'zt', 'zt10<C-y>', { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

Or directly in Vimscript style (if you're using a `.vim` file or mixed configuration):

```vim
nnoremap <silent> zt zt10<C-y>
```

### Testing for Potential Issues
While this mapping should work without causing an infinite loop, here are a few things to watch for:
1. **Conflicting Mappings**: Ensure no other plugin or custom mapping interferes with `zt` or `<C-y>`. You can check existing mappings with `:map zt` or `:map <C-y>` in Neovim.
2. **Behavior Verification**: Test the mapping in different contexts (e.g., near the top or bottom of a file) to confirm it behaves as expected. The `10<C-y>` part might not scroll if you're already near the top of the file, but it won't cause errors or loops.

### Why It Might Seem Like a Loop Could Happen
You might worry about a loop because the left-hand side (`zt`) appears in the right-hand side (`zt10<C-y>`). However, as mentioned, Neovim evaluates the right-hand side as raw commands (especially with `noremap`), so `zt` on the right-hand side is treated as the built-in command, not as a trigger for the mapping itself.

If you were mapping something that could recursively call itself (e.g., a custom sequence that re-triggers the same input), and you didn't use `noremap`, a loop could occur. For example:
```vim
map zt zt
```
This would cause a loop if `zt` on the right-hand side were interpreted as the mapping rather than the built-in command. But since you're using `zt` as a built-in followed by a distinct action (`10<C-y>`), and ideally using `noremap`, there’s no risk.

### Final Notes
Your proposed mapping `zt` to `zt10<C-y>` will work as expected without causing an infinite loop. It will execute the built-in `zt` to scroll the current line to the top, then scroll up 10 lines with `10<C-y>`. If you test it and notice unexpected behavior (e.g., due to other mappings or plugins), let me know, and I can help debug further!
