in neovim, i often love to center the current line by pressing `zz`. is there a way to make it so that the current line is top or bottom rather than center?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Absolutely! In Neovim (and Vim), the `zz` command **centers** the current line in the window. There are also built-in commands to move the current line to the **top** or **bottom** of the window:

- `zt` &nbsp;â†’&nbsp; Move current line to **top** of window
- `zz` &nbsp;â†’&nbsp; Move current line to **center** of window
- `zb` &nbsp;â†’&nbsp; Move current line to **bottom** of window

**Example:**
- Place cursor on a line, hit `zt` â†’ line moves to the top.
- Place cursor on a line, hit `zb` â†’ line moves to the bottom.

**No plugins or remaps required!** These are standard commands. If you want, you can remap them to a different key sequence, but `zt` and `zb` are available out-of-the-box.

great, now, it doesn't seem the `zT` or `zB` commands do anything. i'd like to make `zT` the same as `zt`, except offset by 10 lines, so that i can see what's just above that line. similarly, `zB` would be the same as `zb`, but offset by 10 lines so that i can see what's just below that line. how can i do this?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Great idea! Out of the box, `zT` and `zB` are not standard commands in Vim/Neovimâ€”they don't do anything by default. However, you can **remap** them in your `init.vim` (Vimscript) or `init.lua` (Lua, for Neovim) config to achieve this behavior.

### What you want:
- `zT`: current line is 10 lines from the top of the window
- `zB`: current line is 10 lines from the bottom of the window

---

## Vimscript (`init.vim`)

```vim
" zT: scroll so current line is 10 lines from top
nnoremap zT 10<C-y>zt

" zB: scroll so current line is 10 lines from bottom
nnoremap zB 10<C-e>zb
```

**How it works:**
- `<C-y>` scrolls up one line (without moving the cursor).
- `<C-e>` scrolls down one line (without moving the cursor).
- `zt`/`zb` aligns the line with top/bottom.
- So: you scroll 10 extra lines, then position the line.

---

## Lua (`init.lua` for Neovim)

```lua
-- zT: scroll so current line is 10 lines from top
vim.keymap.set('n', 'zT', '10<C-y>zt', { noremap = true, silent = true })

-- zB: scroll so current line is 10 lines from bottom
vim.keymap.set('n', 'zB', '10<C-e>zb', { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

---

## Usage

- Place the mappings above in your config.
- Restart Neovim.
- Press `zT` or `zB` in normal mode.

**Adjust "10" to any value** for a bigger or smaller offset!

---

### ðŸ”¬ **Optional:** To see the effect, open a long file and move your cursor around, then use the new `zT` and `zB` commands.

Let me know if you'd like a *smarter* function (e.g. one that doesn't scroll past the window edges)!

that's not quite what i want. that moves the cursor and then scrolls. i want to scroll and make sure the cursor is on the same line as before. how do i do that?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Great catch!  
You're right: the mappings I gave (`10<C-y>zt` and `10<C-e>zb`) move the window, and then place the cursor line at the top or bottom, but then *move the window more*, so the cursor is *not* in the same spot relative to the file.

**What you want:**  
- Move the window so the current line is `10` lines below the top (for `zT`), while keeping the cursor on the same *buffer* line.
- Move the window so the current line is `10` lines above the bottom (for `zB`), while keeping the cursor on the same buffer line.

This is **not a built-in command**, but you can simulate it using Vim's `scrolloff` and the `:normal!` command.

---

## Solution 1: Pure Mapping with line movement and window scroll

We'll make a mapping that:
- Remembers your cursor line number (row),
- Runs a window scroll so line is at top,
- Scrolls window down/up by 10 lines (leaving cursor untouched).

**Vimscript version:**
```vim
" zT: place cursor's line 10 lines beneath the top of window
nnoremap zT :call cursor(line('.'), col('.'))<CR>zt10<C-e>

" zB: place cursor's line 10 lines above the bottom of window
nnoremap zB :call cursor(line('.'), col('.'))<CR>zb10<C-y>
```
But you will notice that this still risks moving the cursor if the window can't scroll enough. Let's do it more precisely with a function:

---

## Solution 2: Custom function (works in Neovim Vimscript/Lua)

### Vimscript function

```vim
function! CenterLineOffsetTop(offset)
  let lnum = line('.')
  execute "normal! zt"
  execute "normal! " . a:offset . "\<C-e>"
endfunction

function! CenterLineOffsetBottom(offset)
  let lnum = line('.')
  execute "normal! zb"
  execute "normal! " . a:offset . "\<C-y>"
endfunction

nnoremap zT :call CenterLineOffsetTop(10)<CR>
nnoremap zB :call CenterLineOffsetBottom(10)<CR>
```

### Lua function (Neovim)

```lua
local function zT_offset(offset)
  vim.cmd("normal! zt")
  vim.cmd("normal! " .. offset .. "<C-e>")
end

local function zB_offset(offset)
  vim.cmd("normal! zb")
  vim.cmd("normal! " .. offset .. "<C-y>")
end

vim.keymap.set('n', 'zT', function() zT_offset(10) end, { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.keymap.set('n', 'zB', function() zB_offset(10) end, { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

---

**These solutions keep your cursor on the exact same line**, but shifts the window so it is offset from the top (zT) or bottom (zB). If the window can't scroll all the way (e.g., file start/end), Vim will do its best.

---

## Summary (TL;DR)

- `zt10<C-e>`: puts cursor's line at top, then window scrolls down 10 lines.
- `zb10<C-y>`: puts cursor's line at bottom, then window scrolls up 10 lines.
- The function/mapping **does not move your cursor in the buffer**, only how the window displays around it.

---

### **Try this:**
```vim
nnoremap zT zt10<C-e>
nnoremap zB zb10<C-y>
```
or in Lua:
```lua
vim.keymap.set('n', 'zT', 'zt10<C-e>', { noremap = true, silent = true })
vim.keymap.set('n', 'zB', 'zb10<C-y>', { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

This will keep your cursor on the original line as the window scrolls!

Let me know if you want more advanced behavior (e.g., dynamically center based on window size, etc.).
