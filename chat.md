i use rust and clippy and rust-analyzer in neovim. however, something changed
recently, and this configuration in my nvim config no longer works:

```lua
          settings = {
            ["rust-analyzer"] = {
              cargo = { allFeatures = true },
              checkOnSave = { command = "clippy" }, -- Run clippy on save
            },
          },
```

the rust_tools.setup method is expecting "checkOnSave" to be a boolean. however,
if it is a boolean, how does is know what command to run on save? any idea how
to fix?

# === ASSISTANT ===

The issue you're encountering is likely due to a change in the configuration
structure or API of `rust-analyzer` or `rust-tools.nvim`. The `checkOnSave`
field in the `rust-analyzer` settings used to accept an object with a `command`
field to specify the linter (like `clippy`), but this has changed in newer
versions of `rust-analyzer` or the associated Neovim LSP setup.

In the current setup, `checkOnSave` is expected to be a boolean in
`rust-analyzer` settings, and the command to run (e.g., `clippy`) is configured
separately via `rust-analyzer.diagnostics`. Here's how you can fix it.

### Updated Configuration

You can configure `rust-analyzer` to use `clippy` for diagnostics by setting
`check.command` instead of `checkOnSave.command`. Here's the corrected
configuration for your Neovim setup using `rust-tools.nvim`:

```lua
local rt = require("rust-tools")

rt.setup({
  server = {
    settings = {
      ["rust-analyzer"] = {
        cargo = {
          allFeatures = true,
        },
        check = {
          command = "clippy", -- Use clippy for checking
        },
        checkOnSave = true, -- Enable checking on save
      },
    },
  },
})
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **`checkOnSave`**: This is now a boolean that simply toggles whether
   `rust-analyzer` runs a check when you save a file.
2. **`check.command`**: This specifies the command to run for diagnostics.
   Setting it to `"clippy"` ensures that `clippy` is used for linting and
   diagnostics when `checkOnSave` is enabled.

### Why Did This Happen?

The `rust-analyzer` configuration schema has evolved over time, and older
configurations using `checkOnSave.command` have been deprecated or restructured.
The `rust-tools.nvim` plugin now adheres to the updated schema, where
`checkOnSave` is a boolean and the command is specified under `check.command`.

### Additional Notes

- If you're using an older version of `rust-tools.nvim` or `rust-analyzer`, you
  might need to update them to ensure compatibility with the new configuration
  schema.
- You can check the `rust-analyzer` documentation or the `rust-tools.nvim`
  repository for the latest configuration options to ensure you're using the
  correct fields.
- If you want to confirm the settings are applied, you can use Neovim's
  `:LspInfo` command to inspect the active LSP configuration for
  `rust-analyzer`.

### Troubleshooting

If this configuration still doesn't work:

1. Ensure that `clippy` is installed and accessible in your PATH. You can
   install it with:
   ```bash
   rustup component add clippy
   ```
2. Check if `rust-tools.nvim` or your LSP client is outdated. Update your
   plugins using your Neovim plugin manager (e.g., `PackerSync` or `Lazy`).
3. Look at the LSP logs (`:LspLog`) to see if there are any errors related to
   `rust-analyzer` configuration.

i updated my rust version recently, and i think the lsp has gotten worse. hard
to describe, but i think it's showing me less diagnostics in the editor than
before. are there more settings i need to use to make rust analyzer show more
diagnostics?

```lua
  {
    "simrat39/rust-tools.nvim",
    dependencies = { "neovim/nvim-lspconfig" },
    config = function()
      local rust_tools = require("rust-tools")

      local opts = { noremap = true, silent = true }

      -- rust: Rust tools setup with rust-analyzer
      rust_tools.setup({
        server = {
          on_attach = function(client, bufnr)
            -- Keybindings for LSP features in Rust files
            vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(

              "K",
              "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.hover()<CR>",
              opts
            )
            vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(
              bufnr,
              "n",
              "<Leader>ca",
              "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.code_action()<CR>",

    end,

# === ASSISTANT ===

If you've noticed a decrease in the number of diagnostics shown by
`rust-analyzer` in Neovim after updating your Rust version, there are several
potential reasons and additional settings you can tweak to ensure you're getting
the maximum diagnostics and feedback. Let's go through some common causes and
solutions, and I'll suggest additional `rust-analyzer` settings to enhance
diagnostic reporting.

### Possible Reasons for Fewer Diagnostics

1. **Rust Version Update**: Updating Rust might have changed the behavior of
   `clippy` or `rustc`, which `rust-analyzer` relies on for diagnostics. Newer
   versions of `clippy` might suppress certain warnings by default or require
   explicit configuration.
2. **Rust-Analyzer or Plugin Update**: If `rust-analyzer` or `rust-tools.nvim`
   was updated alongside Rust, the configuration schema or default behavior
   might have changed, leading to fewer diagnostics being shown.
3. **Diagnostics Settings**: By default, `rust-analyzer` might not show all
   diagnostics (e.g., warnings from dependencies or certain lints) unless
   explicitly configured.
4. **Neovim LSP Client**: The Neovim LSP client or `rust-tools.nvim` might
   filter or limit diagnostics display based on severity or other settings.

### Enhancing Diagnostics in Rust-Analyzer

To ensure you're seeing as many diagnostics as possible, you can configure
`rust-analyzer` to be more verbose and include diagnostics from `clippy`,
dependencies, and other sources. Below is an updated version of your
configuration with additional settings to maximize diagnostics.

### Updated Configuration

```lua
{
  "simrat39/rust-tools.nvim",
  dependencies = { "neovim/nvim-lspconfig" },
  config = function()
    local rust_tools = require("rust-tools")

    local opts = { noremap = true, silent = true }

    -- rust: Rust tools setup with rust-analyzer
    rust_tools.setup({
      server = {
        on_attach = function(client, bufnr)
          -- Keybindings for LSP features in Rust files
          vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(
            bufnr,
            "n",
            "gd",
            "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.definition()<CR>",
            opts
          )
          vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(
            bufnr,
            "n",
            "K",
            "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.hover()<CR>",
            opts
          )
          vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(
            bufnr,
            "n",
            "<Leader>ca",
            "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.code_action()<CR>",
            opts
          )
          vim.api.nvim_buf_set_keymap(
            bufnr,
            "n",
            "<Leader>rn",
            "<cmd>lua vim.lsp.buf.rename()<CR>",
            opts
          )
        end,
        settings = {
          ["rust-analyzer"] = {
            cargo = {
              allFeatures = true, -- Build with all features enabled
              features = "all", -- Ensure all features are considered during analysis
            },
            check = {
              command = "clippy", -- Use clippy for checking
              features = "all", -- Enable all features for clippy
              extraArgs = { "--all", "--", "-W", "clippy::all", "-W", "clippy::pedantic" }, -- Enable more clippy lints
            },
            checkOnSave = true, -- Run checks on save
            diagnostics = {
              enable = true, -- Explicitly enable diagnostics
              disabled = {}, -- Don't disable any diagnostics by default
              enableExperimental = true, -- Enable experimental diagnostics (if available)
            },
            rustc = {
              source = "discover", -- Automatically discover rustc source for better diagnostics
            },
          },
        },
      },
    })
  end,
},
```

### Explanation of New Settings

1. **`check.extraArgs`**: This allows you to pass additional arguments to
   `clippy`. Here, I've added `--all` to check all targets, and `-W clippy::all`
   and `-W clippy::pedantic` to enable more strict lints. This can surface more
   warnings and suggestions that might have been suppressed.
2. **`diagnostics.enable` and `diagnostics.disabled`**: Explicitly enabling
   diagnostics and ensuring no categories are disabled by default helps ensure
   you're seeing everything `rust-analyzer` can report.
3. **`diagnostics.enableExperimental`**: This enables experimental diagnostics
   that might not be fully stable but can provide additional feedback.
4. **`rustc.source = "discover"`**: This tells `rust-analyzer` to automatically
   detect the `rustc` source, which can improve diagnostics by ensuring the
   correct version of the compiler is used for analysis.

### Additional Steps to Diagnose and Fix

If you're still seeing fewer diagnostics after applying these settings, consider
the following steps:

1. **Check Clippy Version and Lints**:
   - Ensure `clippy` is installed and up-to-date:
     ```bash
     rustup component add clippy
     rustup update
     ```
   - Run `clippy` manually on your project to see if it produces more
     diagnostics than `rust-analyzer` shows:
     ```bash
     cargo clippy --all-features --all -- -W clippy::all -W clippy::pedantic
     ```
   - If `clippy` shows more diagnostics in the terminal, the issue might be with
     how `rust-analyzer` integrates or filters diagnostics.

2. **Inspect LSP Logs**:
   - Use Neovim's `:LspLog` command to check for errors or warnings from
     `rust-analyzer`. This can reveal configuration issues or suppressed
     diagnostics.
   - Look for messages about ignored or filtered diagnostics.

3. **Check Neovim Diagnostic Settings**:
   - Ensure that Neovim's diagnostic display isn't filtering out warnings or
     info-level diagnostics. You can configure this globally or per-buffer
     using:
     ```lua
     vim.diagnostic.config({
       virtual_text = true, -- Show diagnostics as virtual text
       signs = true, -- Show signs in the gutter
       underline = true, -- Underline issues
       severity_sort = true, -- Sort by severity
       float = {
         border = "rounded",
         source = "always", -- Show source of diagnostics
       },
     })
     ```
   - If diagnostics are still not showing, ensure no other plugin (like a linter
     or formatter) is interfering with LSP diagnostics.

4. **Update Rust-Analyzer and Plugins**:
   - Ensure `rust-analyzer` is up-to-date. If you're using a plugin manager like
     `packer.nvim` or `lazy.nvim`, update all plugins:
     ```lua
     :PackerSync  -- or equivalent for your plugin manager
     ```
   - You can also manually update `rust-analyzer` if installed separately:
     ```bash
     rustup component add rust-analyzer
     ```

5. **Check Project Configuration**:
   - If your project has a `.cargo/config.toml` or `Cargo.toml` with specific
     `clippy` or `rustc` settings, they might suppress diagnostics. Look for
     `lint` or `warn` configurations and adjust them to allow more warnings.

6. **Verbose Output**:
   - Temporarily enable verbose logging for `rust-analyzer` to see what it's
     doing. Add this to your settings:
     ```lua
     ["rust-analyzer"] = {
       trace = {
         server = "verbose", -- Enable verbose logging
       },
     }
     ```
   - Check the logs with `:LspLog` to see if diagnostics are being generated but
     not displayed.

### Final Notes

- If you're still not seeing the expected diagnostics, consider comparing the
  behavior with a minimal Neovim configuration to rule out plugin interference.
- You can also test `rust-analyzer` in another editor (like VS Code with the
  Rust extension) to confirm if the issue is with `rust-analyzer` itself or
  Neovim's LSP integration.

Let me know if you need help interpreting logs or if the issue persists after
trying these settings!

if i wanted to remap `zt` to `zt10<C-y>`, would that be an infinite loop, or
would that work?

# === ASSISTANT ===

Remapping `zt` to `zt10<C-y>` in Neovim would **not** result in an infinite
loop, and it should work as intended, provided you define the mapping correctly.
Let's break down why this is the case and how to implement it.

### Why It Won't Cause an Infinite Loop

In Neovim (and Vim), when you create a mapping for a key or sequence like `zt`,
the mapping applies to the user input, not to the internal execution of
commands. The `zt` in your mapping on the right-hand side (`zt10<C-y>`) is
interpreted as the literal command `zt`, not as a recursive call to your custom
mapping. Neovim does not re-evaluate the mapped command through the mapping
system unless you explicitly use a recursive mapping (e.g., with `noremap` not
being used).

By default, mappings created with `map` are recursive, meaning if `zt` on the
right-hand side referred to a custom mapping, it could potentially cause a loop.
However, since `zt` is a built-in Vim command (which scrolls the current line to
the top of the window), it is not subject to remapping during execution. Thus,
`zt` in `zt10<C-y>` will always execute the original built-in behavior of `zt`,
not your custom mapping.

Additionally, using `noremap` (or its mode-specific variants like `nnoremap`)
ensures that the right-hand side of the mapping is interpreted literally,
without considering any other mappings. This further prevents any risk of
recursion.

### What `zt10<C-y>` Does

- `zt`: Scrolls the current line to the top of the window.
- `10<C-y>`: Scrolls the view up by 10 lines (since `<C-y>` scrolls up one line
  by default, and the `10` prefix multiplies the effect).

So, `zt10<C-y>` will first position the current line at the top of the window
(`zt`), then scroll the view up by 10 lines (`10<C-y>`), effectively positioning
the current line 10 lines below the top of the window after the initial `zt`.

### How to Implement the Mapping

To remap `zt` to `zt10<C-y>`, you can use the following in your Neovim
configuration (e.g., in your `init.lua` or equivalent):

```lua
vim.keymap.set('n', 'zt', 'zt10<C-y>', { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

### Explanation of Options

- `'n'`: Applies the mapping in normal mode.
- `noremap = true`: Ensures the right-hand side (`zt10<C-y>`) is not subject to
  further remapping, though in this case, it’s not strictly necessary since `zt`
  and `<C-y>` are built-in commands.
- `silent = true`: Prevents the command from being echoed in the command line.

Alternatively, if you're using the older `nvim_buf_set_keymap` or raw Vim
commands, you can write it as:

```lua
vim.api.nvim_set_keymap('n', 'zt', 'zt10<C-y>', { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

Or directly in Vimscript style (if you're using a `.vim` file or mixed
configuration):

```vim
nnoremap <silent> zt zt10<C-y>
```

### Testing for Potential Issues

While this mapping should work without causing an infinite loop, here are a few
things to watch for:

1. **Conflicting Mappings**: Ensure no other plugin or custom mapping interferes
   with `zt` or `<C-y>`. You can check existing mappings with `:map zt` or
   `:map <C-y>` in Neovim.
2. **Behavior Verification**: Test the mapping in different contexts (e.g., near
   the top or bottom of a file) to confirm it behaves as expected. The `10<C-y>`
   part might not scroll if you're already near the top of the file, but it
   won't cause errors or loops.

### Why It Might Seem Like a Loop Could Happen

You might worry about a loop because the left-hand side (`zt`) appears in the
right-hand side (`zt10<C-y>`). However, as mentioned, Neovim evaluates the
right-hand side as raw commands (especially with `noremap`), so `zt` on the
right-hand side is treated as the built-in command, not as a trigger for the
mapping itself.

If you were mapping something that could recursively call itself (e.g., a custom
sequence that re-triggers the same input), and you didn't use `noremap`, a loop
could occur. For example:

```vim
map zt zt
```

This would cause a loop if `zt` on the right-hand side were interpreted as the
mapping rather than the built-in command. But since you're using `zt` as a
built-in followed by a distinct action (`10<C-y>`), and ideally using `noremap`,
there’s no risk.

### Final Notes

Your proposed mapping `zt` to `zt10<C-y>` will work as expected without causing
an infinite loop. It will execute the built-in `zt` to scroll the current line
to the top, then scroll up 10 lines with `10<C-y>`. If you test it and notice
unexpected behavior (e.g., due to other mappings or plugins), let me know, and I
can help debug further!

# === USER ===

in neovim, is there a way to select the current line, but not with `V`, which
selects the newline at the end, but rather just the text of the current line
without including the newline character?

# === ASSISTANT ===

In Neovim (and Vim), the `V` command selects the current line in line-wise
visual mode, which includes the newline character at the end of the line. If you
want to select only the text of the current line without the newline character,
you can use character-wise visual mode (`v`) combined with specific motions to
achieve this.

There isn't a built-in single command to directly select "the current line
without the newline," but you can create a custom mapping or use a sequence of
commands to do it. Below, I'll explain how to do this manually and how to map it
for convenience.

### Manual Method to Select Current Line Without Newline

You can select the text of the current line (excluding the newline) by using
character-wise visual mode (`v`) and moving from the start to the end of the
line's text:

1. Move to the start of the line's text (ignoring leading whitespace if
   desired):
   - `^` : Move to the first non-whitespace character of the line.
   - Alternatively, use `0` to move to the absolute start of the line (including
     leading whitespace).
2. Enter visual mode with `v`.
3. Move to the end of the line's text:
   - `$h` : Move to the last character of the line (`$` moves to the end,
     including the newline, and `h` moves one character left to exclude it).

So, the full sequence would be:

- `^v$h` (if starting from the first non-whitespace character)
- OR `0v$h` (if starting from the absolute beginning of the line)

This selects all characters on the current line, from the start to the last
character before the newline.

### Custom Mapping to Automate This

To make this easier, you can create a custom mapping in your Neovim
configuration to select the current line's text (without the newline) in
character-wise visual mode. Here's how to do it in Lua for your `init.lua`:

```lua
vim.keymap.set('n', 'vl', '0v$h', { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

#### Explanation:

- `'n'`: Applies the mapping in normal mode.
- `vl`: The keybinding you’re assigning (you can change this to whatever you
  prefer, e.g., `<Leader>l`).
- `0v$h`: The sequence of commands:
  - `0`: Move to the start of the line.
  - `v`: Enter character-wise visual mode.
  - `$h`: Move to the last character before the newline.
- `noremap = true`: Prevents recursive mapping.
- `silent = true`: Suppresses command output in the command line.

If you want to start from the first non-whitespace character instead of the
absolute start, use `^` instead of `0`:

```lua
vim.keymap.set('n', 'vl', '^v$h', { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

#### Using Vimscript (if preferred):

If you're using a `.vim` file or prefer Vimscript, you can add:

```vim
nnoremap <silent> vl 0v$h
" OR
nnoremap <silent> vl ^v$h
```

### Edge Cases and Notes

1. **Empty Lines**: If the current line is empty (just a newline), this mapping
   will select nothing, as there are no characters to select. `$h` won't move
   left if there's no character before the newline.
2. **Lines with Trailing Whitespace**: The `$h` motion will stop at the last
   non-newline character, so trailing whitespace will be included in the
   selection. If you want to exclude trailing whitespace, you’d need a more
   complex mapping or plugin.
3. **Behavior with Plugins**: Some plugins might override or interfere with
   visual mode selections. If you notice unexpected behavior, check for
   conflicting mappings with `:map vl` (or whatever keybinding you chose).

### Alternative with a Plugin or Function

If you frequently need to select lines without newlines (or with other specific
behaviors like ignoring trailing whitespace), you can write a small Lua function
or use a plugin. Here's an example of a more customized Lua function to select
the current line's text:

```lua
vim.keymap.set('n', 'vl', function()
  local line = vim.api.nvim_get_current_line()
  if line == "" then
    return -- Do nothing if the line is empty
  end
  vim.cmd('normal! 0v$h') -- Select from start to last character
end, { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

This function checks if the line is empty before attempting to select, avoiding
unnecessary visual mode entry on empty lines.

### Final Notes

- The simplest and most straightforward way is to use `0v$h` or `^v$h` via a
  custom mapping like the one above.
- If you need more advanced selection logic (e.g., excluding trailing
  whitespace), let me know, and I can help craft a more detailed function or
  suggest a plugin.

Try the mapping above, and if you have any issues or want to tweak the behavior
further, feel free to ask!

there is something weird going on with folding in neovim. i have folds enabled
by default. however, files often load without them. then, i will accidentally
press some key strokes which cause the folds to exist. the difference is that
somewhere in ny neovim config is some setting that puts fold information on the
left side of the window. this information will just suddently appear, without
being intentionally provoked by me. however, i haven't yet figured out which
unintentional keystrokes i am hitting that makes this happen. any idea what
these keystrokes are? again, folds are always "enabled", but when i try to close
a fold, it often says "no folds found", unless i press this myserious key
combination first.

# === ASSISTANT ===

It sounds like you're experiencing some inconsistent behavior with folding in
Neovim, where folds are enabled by default but not always active when files
load, and some unintentional keystrokes seem to "activate" them along with fold
information (likely fold markers or the fold column) appearing on the left side
of the window. Let's break this down and identify possible causes, likely
keystrokes, and solutions to make folding behavior more consistent.

### Understanding the Issue

1. **Folds Enabled but Not Active**: You mention folds are "enabled by default,"
   but files often load without folds being applied (e.g., `no folds found` when
   trying to close a fold). This suggests that while Neovim has folding enabled,
   the fold method or fold expression might not be creating folds automatically
   until triggered.
2. **Unintentional Keystrokes Activating Folds**: Some key combination you're
   pressing is likely triggering a command to update or create folds, or to
   enable the fold column (the left-side information you're seeing).
3. **Fold Information on Left Side**: This is almost certainly the fold column,
   which displays indicators (like `+` for closed folds and `-` for open folds)
   to show fold levels. Its sudden appearance suggests a command is toggling it
   on.

### Likely Causes and Keystrokes

Since folds are enabled but not always active, and some mystery keystrokes are
making them appear along with the fold column, here are the most likely
scenarios:

#### 1. Fold Method or Initialization Issue

- Neovim supports different fold methods (`manual`, `indent`, `expr`, `syntax`,
  etc.), and folds might not be created automatically on file load if:
  - The fold method is `manual` (default in many setups), requiring explicit
    fold creation.
  - The fold method is `expr` or `syntax`, but the expression or syntax rules
    aren't applied until a specific command or buffer refresh.
- If you're using a plugin like `treesitter` for folding (common with modern
  Neovim configs), folds might not initialize until a specific action or command
  is run.

#### 2. Common Keystrokes That Could Activate Folds

Here are some common keystrokes that might be triggering the behavior you're
seeing:

- **`zx`**: Updates folds by recalculating them based on the current fold
  method. If folds weren't visible or applied on load, pressing `zx` would
  create or refresh them, making them available for opening/closing. This could
  explain why `no folds found` changes after pressing something.
- **`zR`**: Opens all folds in the buffer. If folds exist but are closed by
  default, this would make them appear "active" (though they were there all
  along).
- **`zM`**: Closes all folds. If you press this accidentally, it might make
  folds visible in the sense that you now see closed fold markers.
- **`za` or `zo`**: Toggles or opens a fold under the cursor. If folds weren't
  rendered or applied yet, Neovim might lazily initialize them when you attempt
  to interact with a fold.
- **`set foldcolumn` or Related Commands**: If you accidentally trigger a
  command like `:set foldcolumn=auto` or `:set foldcolumn=1`, it would enable
  the fold column on the left side. This might happen if you have a mapping or
  plugin that toggles it, or if you're accidentally entering command mode (e.g.,
  pressing `:` followed by random keys).

#### 3. Fold Column Appearing

- The fold column (the left-side information) is controlled by the `foldcolumn`
  option. If it suddenly appears, you might be:
  - Pressing a mapped key that toggles `foldcolumn` (e.g., a leader key or
    plugin binding).
  - Triggering a plugin like `ufo.nvim` or `treesitter` that manages fold
    visualization and toggles the fold column.
  - Accidentally running a command like `:set fdc=1` (short for `foldcolumn=1`).

#### 4. Plugin or Config Interference

- If you're using a folding plugin (like `nvim-ufo`, which enhances folding with
  Treesitter), it might have custom mappings or delayed initialization, causing
  folds to appear only after certain actions.
- Your Neovim config might have `autocmd` events or mappings that toggle fold
  settings or refresh folds on specific actions (like saving or moving the
  cursor).

### How to Investigate and Fix

Let’s go through steps to identify the mystery keystrokes and stabilize your
folding setup.

#### 1. Check Your Current Fold Settings

Run these commands in Neovim to see your current fold configuration:

- `:set foldmethod?` : Shows the fold method (`manual`, `indent`, `expr`, etc.).
- `:set foldexpr?` : Shows the expression used for folding if `foldmethod=expr`.
- `:set foldcolumn?` : Shows the current fold column setting (e.g., `0` for
  disabled, `1` or higher for enabled).
- `:set foldenable?` : Confirms if folding is enabled (should be `foldenable`).

If `foldmethod=manual`, folds won't be created automatically unless you define
them or run a command like `zx`. If it's `expr` or `syntax`, ensure the rules
are set up correctly.

#### 2. Identify Mystery Keystrokes

To figure out what you're pressing that activates folds or the fold column:

- **Check Mappings**: Run `:map` or mode-specific commands like `:nmap` (normal
  mode mappings) to see if any keys are mapped to fold-related commands (`zx`,
  `zR`, `za`, etc.) or to toggle `foldcolumn`.
  - Look for mappings involving `z` (common for fold commands) or `<Leader>`
    keys that might toggle settings.
- **Enable Key Logging (Debugging)**: Neovim doesn't have built-in key logging,
  but you can temporarily enable verbose output to see what commands are being
  executed:
  - Run `:set verbose=9` and then interact with your editor as usual. Check the
    output with `:messages` to see what commands or mappings are triggered when
    folds or the fold column appear.
- **Common Culprits**: Since fold commands often start with `z`, you might be
  accidentally pressing keys like `zx`, `za`, or `zR` while typing or
  navigating. For example, if you meant to type `x` but hit `zx`, it would
  update folds.

#### 3. Stabilize Fold Initialization

To ensure folds are always applied on file load and prevent the "no folds found"
issue:

- **Set Fold Method**: If you want automatic folding, set `foldmethod` to
  something like `indent` or `syntax` in your config. For example, in
  `init.lua`:
  ```lua
  vim.opt.foldmethod = 'indent' -- or 'syntax' or 'expr' depending on preference
  vim.opt.foldenable = true -- Ensure folding is enabled
  vim.opt.foldlevelstart = 99 -- Start with all folds open (adjust as needed)
  ```
- **Force Fold Update on Load**: Add an `autocmd` to update folds when a file is
  loaded:
  ```lua
  vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({"BufReadPost", "FileReadPost"}, {
    pattern = "*",
    command = "normal zx", -- Update folds on file load
  })
  ```
  This runs `zx` after a buffer is read, ensuring folds are calculated and
  applied.

#### 4. Control Fold Column Visibility

If the fold column appearing unexpectedly is bothersome, check if it’s enabled
by default or toggled by a mapping:

- **Check Default Setting**: Run `:set foldcolumn?`. If it’s not `0`, it’s
  enabled by default in your config. Disable it with:
  ```lua
  vim.opt.foldcolumn = '0' -- Disable fold column by default
  ```
- **Look for Toggles**: Search your config for `foldcolumn` or `fdc` to see if a
  plugin or mapping toggles it. Common plugins like `nvim-ufo` might enable it
  automatically.
- **Temporary Toggle Mapping**: If you want to control it manually, add a
  mapping to toggle the fold column:
  ```lua
  vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>fc', ':set foldcolumn!<CR>', { noremap = true, silent = true })
  ```

#### 5. Check for Plugins

If you're using a folding plugin (e.g., `nvim-ufo` with Treesitter), check its
documentation for default mappings or initialization behavior. For example,
`nvim-ufo` often uses `zR`, `zM`, and other `z`-based keys for fold management,
and it might enable the fold column automatically. You can disable or remap
these in the plugin’s setup.

### Likely Keystrokes You're Hitting

Based on your description, the most likely unintentional keystrokes are:

- **`zx`**: Updates folds, making them available if they weren’t applied on
  load.
- **`za` or `zo`**: Attempts to toggle/open a fold, which might trigger fold
  initialization.
- A custom mapping or plugin key that toggles `foldcolumn` or refreshes folds.

### Final Recommendations

1. Add the fold initialization `autocmd` mentioned above to ensure folds are
   always applied on load.
2. Set `foldcolumn=0` if you don’t want the left-side information by default, or
   map a toggle for it.
3. Run `:map | grep z` to see all fold-related mappings and identify potential
   accidental triggers.
4. If using a plugin like `nvim-ufo`, review its setup and mappings in your
   config.

Here’s a minimal config snippet to stabilize folding behavior:

```lua
vim.opt.foldmethod = 'indent' -- or 'syntax' or 'expr'
vim.opt.foldenable = true
vim.opt.foldlevelstart = 99 -- Start with folds open
vim.opt.foldcolumn = '0' -- Disable fold column by default

-- Update folds on file load
vim.api.nvim_create_autocmd({"BufReadPost", "FileReadPost"}, {
  pattern = "*",
  command = "normal zx",
})

-- Optional: Toggle fold column
vim.keymap.set('n', '<Leader>fc', ':set foldcolumn!<CR>', { noremap = true, silent = true })
```

If you’re still seeing unexpected behavior or want help debugging specific
mappings or plugins, share relevant parts of your config or the output of
`:map | grep z`, and I’ll help narrow it down further!
